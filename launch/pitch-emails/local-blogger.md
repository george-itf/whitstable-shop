Hi [Name],

I came across your [blog/Instagram] and loved your [specific post or content about Kent/Whitstable]. Your [specific compliment] really resonated.

I wanted to share something I've been working on that might be useful for your readers: whitstable.shop.

**What it is**: A free, mobile-friendly guide to Whitstable's independent shops, restaurants, and cafes. Think of it as a curated directory with user reviews, an interactive map, events calendar, and practical info like tide times and parking.

**Why I built it**: Whitstable's high street is amazing, but finding everything used to mean piecing together Google Maps, Facebook, and word of mouth. I wanted one place visitors could use to discover the best spots.

**Why I'm reaching out**: I'm not asking for coverage or promotion—I just thought it might be a useful resource for:
- Your own visits/research
- Linking in Whitstable-related posts
- Sharing with readers planning trips

If you do find it useful and want to mention it, that would be wonderful, but no pressure at all.

I'd also love any feedback if you have thoughts on making it more useful.

Thanks for creating great content about Kent!

[Your name]
whitstable.shop

## Research Notes

When pitching bloggers:

1. **Read their content first**: Don't pitch blindly
2. **Check if they've covered Whitstable**: More relevant pitch
3. **Note their style**: Match your tone to theirs
4. **Find the right contact**: Personal email > generic form
5. **Track responses**: Don't double-pitch
