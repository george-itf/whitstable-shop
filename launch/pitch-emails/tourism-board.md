Dear [Name / Tourism Team],

I've recently launched whitstable.shop, a free digital platform helping visitors discover Whitstable's independent shops, restaurants, and local businesses.

**About the Platform**

whitstable.shop is a mobile-friendly guide featuring:

- **80+ independent businesses** with descriptions, hours, and contact details
- **User reviews and ratings** from the community
- **Interactive map** for exploring on foot
- **Events calendar** for local happenings
- **Practical information** including tide times, parking, and transport

The platform is designed for visitors—particularly day-trippers from London and tourists exploring Kent's coast.

**Why This Matters**

Whitstable's independent high street is a key draw for visitors, but there hasn't been a comprehensive, mobile-friendly guide dedicated to local businesses. whitstable.shop fills this gap, helping visitors discover and support the shops that make Whitstable special.

**Partnership Opportunities**

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how whitstable.shop could support Visit Kent's / [Organisation's] goals:

- **Cross-promotion**: Feature whitstable.shop in visitor guides or digital resources
- **Content sharing**: Embed our events calendar or shop listings
- **Data insights**: Share (anonymised) visitor patterns and popular businesses
- **Joint initiatives**: Collaborate on "shop local" campaigns

**About Me**

I'm [Your name], a [background]. I built whitstable.shop independently to support local businesses and help visitors have better experiences in Whitstable.

I'd love to schedule a call to discuss potential collaboration. I'm available at your convenience.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
