Hi [Name / News Desk],

I've just launched whitstable.shop, a free platform dedicated to Whitstable's independent shops and businesses.

**The quick version**: It's a mobile-friendly directory of 80+ local businesses with reviews, an interactive map, events calendar, and local info like tide times and parking. No chains, no ads—just the independents.

**Why I built it**: As a [resident/frequent visitor], I wanted a single place to discover and support local shops. Google Maps mixes chains with independents, and there wasn't a definitive Whitstable guide. So I built one.

**What makes it different**:
- Only independent businesses (no national chains)
- Includes practical local info visitors actually need
- Completely free for shops to be listed
- No advertising or sponsored placements

The site is live now at whitstable.shop, and local businesses can claim their listings for free.

I'd love to share more about the project. Happy to:
- Provide a full press release and media kit
- Do an interview (phone, email, or in person in Whitstable)
- Arrange photos in town if useful

Thanks for your time. I'm passionate about supporting local high streets and would love to share the story.

Best,
