## Review Guidelines

### What Makes a Great Review

**Be Specific**
Share particular details about your experience. Instead of "great food", try "the crab linguine was perfectly cooked, generous portions, and the garlic bread was still warm when served."

**Be Balanced**
It's okay to mention both positives and areas for improvement. Balanced reviews are more trustworthy and more helpful.

**Be Recent**
Review based on recent visits. If your last visit was years ago, your review might not reflect the current experience.

**Be Yourself**
Write in your own voice. Reviews don't need to be formal or perfectly written - just genuine.

### Examples

**Good Review**:
> "Visited on a Saturday afternoon. The coffee was excellent - strong and served in a proper cup. Loved the cozy atmosphere, though it was quite busy. Staff were friendly despite the rush. The brownie was a bit dry but I'd still come back for the flat white. 4/5"

**Poor Review**:
> "WORST PLACE EVER!!!! Never going back. Terrible!!!!"

### What's Not Allowed

- **Fake reviews**: Don't review places you haven't visited
- **Paid reviews**: Don't accept payment or free items for reviews
- **Conflict of interest**: Don't review your own business or competitors
- **Personal attacks**: Criticise the experience, not individuals
- **Irrelevant content**: Stay on topic about the business
- **Discriminatory content**: No hate speech or discrimination
- **Spam**: No promotional links or advertising

## Rating Guidelines

Use the full rating scale thoughtfully:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 5 stars | Exceptional - Would highly recommend to anyone |
| 4 stars | Great - Really enjoyed, minor issues |
| 3 stars | Average - Decent but nothing special |
| 2 stars | Below average - Significant issues |
| 1 star | Poor - Would not return |

**Note**: A 3-star review isn't "bad" - it's honest feedback that an experience was average. Use the full scale!

---

## Photo Guidelines

Photos enhance reviews and help others. When adding photos:

- **Take your own**: Only upload photos you took yourself
- **Be relevant**: Show the shop, products, or your experience
- **Be appropriate**: No offensive or inappropriate content
- **Be considerate**: Ask permission before photographing staff
- **Be helpful**: Good lighting, clear focus, shows useful details
