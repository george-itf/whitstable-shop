## the checklist

### would a local say this?
Read it aloud in a Whitstable accent (or imagine someone doing so). Does it sound like something a local would actually say to a friend? Or does it sound like marketing copy, tourist board prose, or generic travel writing?

**red flags:** phrases like "this charming seaside town", "a must-visit destination", "something for everyone"

### is there a specific detail that proves you've been there?
Anyone can write vague praise from Google research. The details prove authenticity. The name of the person who serves you. The specific dish. The quirk of the building. The view from a particular seat. The thing you'd only know if you'd actually been.

**example of vague:** "The seafood here is excellent."
**example of specific:** "The smoked mackerel pâté comes in a small ceramic pot with sourdough toast — ask for extra toast, you'll want it."

### did you take a position or hide behind vagueness?
We have opinions. We share them. "It's all good in different ways" is a cop-out. If you had to recommend one thing, what would it be? Say that.

**vague:** "Both restaurants have their merits."
**position:** "I prefer Wheeler's for atmosphere, but the Oyster Company has the better view."

### would you send this to a friend visiting?
Imagine a friend texts you asking about Whitstable. Would you copy and paste what you've written? Or would you be embarrassed because it sounds too formal, too promotional, or too generic?

**test:** actually imagine sending it. Your gut will tell you.

### is there anything a tourist board would never say?
Tourist boards have to be diplomatic. They can't mention downsides, criticise businesses, or be too specific in their recommendations. If everything in your piece could have been written by a tourist board, it's too safe.

**tourist board safe:** "Whitstable offers a range of dining options to suit all tastes."
**actually useful:** "Skip the places on the harbour front with the big signs — they're overpriced and mediocre. Walk two minutes inland to Samphire instead."

### did you mention a downside or caveat?
Nothing is perfect. Mentioning the downsides makes your praise credible. The queue, the price, the limited hours, the thing that doesn't work as well. Readers trust writers who are honest about imperfections.

**too positive:** "Wheeler's is perfect in every way."
**honest:** "Wheeler's doesn't take bookings, which is frustrating if you've driven an hour. But that queue is half the experience."

### does it sound like a human wrote it?
AI-generated content, SEO-optimised content, and committee-written content all have a certain flatness. Real human writing has personality, rhythm, idiosyncrasy. Read it aloud. Does it have a voice?

**robotic:** "Whitstable is known for its excellent oysters and charming harbour area."
**human:** "People bang on about the oysters, and fair enough — they're good. But honestly, I come for the walk along the harbour wall when the tide's high and the light's doing that thing where everything goes silver."

### would you be embarrassed if the shop owner read it?
We write honestly, but we're not trying to harm businesses. If you wrote something negative, is it fair? Is it true? Is it something you'd stand behind if the owner asked you about it? If you'd be embarrassed, reconsider.

**note:** this doesn't mean only write nice things. It means write things you can defend.

### is it true?
Did you check? Especially for facts like opening hours, prices, what's on the menu, historical claims. If you're not sure, find out or remove the claim. Getting facts wrong destroys trust.

## how to use this

1. Write your first draft without overthinking
2. Let it sit (even briefly)
3. Go through the checklist
4. Rewrite anything that doesn't pass
5. Repeat until everything passes

This seems like a lot. It gets faster with practice. Eventually, you'll write this way naturally and the checklist becomes a quick final scan.

## examples of rewrites

### before
"Whitstable is a delightful seaside town in Kent, known for its oysters and charming harbour. Whether you're a foodie, a nature lover, or just looking for a relaxing day out, Whitstable has something to offer."

### after
"Whitstable is a small town on the Kent coast that's become famous for oysters and weekenders from London. It's genuinely good — the seafood, the beaches, the pubs — but it's not some undiscovered paradise. On summer weekends, it's rammed. The trick is knowing when to come and where to go once you're here."

### what changed
- Removed "delightful" (vague praise)
- Removed "charming" (banned word)
- Removed "whether you're... or..." (banned construction)
- Removed "something to offer" (meaningless)
- Added honest context about crowds
- Added useful perspective
- Took a position

---

### before
"The Old Neptune is a wonderful pub right on the beach. The atmosphere is great and the drinks are good. It's definitely worth a visit."

### after
"The Neptune — locals call it the Neppy — is a pub sitting directly on the shingle, which sounds made up but isn't. It floods sometimes. It's absolutely heaving in summer and you'll struggle to get near the bar. But on a Wednesday evening in October, when the wind's up and you're sitting inside with a pint watching the waves hit the wall, there's nothing like it."

### what changed
- Removed "wonderful" and "great" (vague)
- Removed "definitely worth a visit" (tourist board phrase)
- Added local name (proves knowledge)
- Added specific downsides (flooding, crowds)
- Added specific when-to-go recommendation
- Added sensory detail (wind, waves, sitting with a pint)
- Created a scene, not just a description

## the ultimate test

After all the checkbox stuff, there's one final question:

**"If someone read only this, would they trust that whitstable.shop knows Whitstable better than Google ever could?"**

If the answer is yes, publish.

If there's any doubt, you know what to do.
