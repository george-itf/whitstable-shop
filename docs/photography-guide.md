# whitstable.shop photography guide

Photos on whitstable.shop should feel like they were taken by someone who lives here — not a professional photographer on assignment, not a stock photo agency. Real, natural, honest.

## the aesthetic

### natural light, always
No flash. No aggressive studio lighting. The soft, coastal light of Whitstable is the whole point. Early morning and late afternoon are best. Overcast days are often better than harsh sunshine.

### soft colours
The Whitstable palette is muted. Grey-blue sea, weathered wood, faded beach huts, oyster shells, pebbles. Don't oversaturate. Don't punch up the colours. Let them be what they are.

### not oversaturated
This is the biggest mistake people make. Those turquoise-and-orange Instagram shots of sunsets? That's not what it actually looks like. Keep colours true to life.

### not HDR
No HDR processing. Ever. It makes everything look plastic and unreal. If the dynamic range is too wide, take a different shot.

### all seasons, all weather
We need winter photos as much as summer. Fog over the harbour. Rain on the windows. Wind whipping the beach. These are as much part of Whitstable as sunny beach days. Don't only shoot on pretty days.

### quiet as well as busy
A lot of our content is about finding the quieter moments. We need photos of empty streets at dawn, closed-up beach huts in winter, the harbour without crowds. Not everything needs people in it.

### details matter
The texture of an oyster shell. The chalk handwriting on a menu board. The steam rising from a coffee. The patina on a door handle. These details tell stories that wide shots don't.

### candid over posed
If there are people in the shot, they should be doing something — eating, talking, walking, working. Not looking at the camera and smiling. Real moments, not staged ones.

### weather included
Don't try to hide the weather. If it's grey, let it be grey. If it's raining, show the rain. Whitstable isn't a sunny beach resort and shouldn't pretend to be.

## shot list per shop

When photographing any shop or venue, aim for these five core shots:

### 1. exterior with context
Not just the building, but its surroundings. The street it's on, the neighbouring shops, how it sits in Whitstable. This helps people find it and understand its location.

### 2. interior atmosphere
What does it feel like inside? The lighting, the layout, the mood. Not a clinical overview shot — something that captures the vibe.

### 3. the signature item
Whatever they're known for. The oysters, the coffee, the bread, the books. Shot in context, being used or eaten, not isolated on a white background.

### 4. a personality detail
Something that captures what makes this place this place. The hand-painted sign, the collection of mugs, the view from the window, the cat on the counter. The thing you'd notice if you were there.

### 5. a person (if permitted)
Staff or customers, with permission. Ideally doing their thing — making coffee, shucking oysters, browsing shelves. This is optional and requires consent, but adds humanity.

## what to avoid

### aggressive filters
No VSCO presets cranked to maximum. No heavy colour grading. No fake film grain. Keep processing minimal and natural.

### stock photo angles
You know the ones. The overhead flat lay. The perfectly arranged breakfast. The couple walking into the sunset holding hands. If it looks like it could be anywhere, it's wrong.

### empty food shots
Food should look like food, not a still life. If it's a dish at a restaurant, show the table, the setting, the context. Isolated hero shots feel sterile.

### only sunny summer days
This is Kent, not the Mediterranean. It's grey more often than it's sunny. We need photos that reflect reality, not a fantasy version.

### the same three tourist shots
The harbour sign. The Neptune from the exact same angle. The Slopes with the grass in foreground. These are fine, but we need more. Find new angles, new moments, new views.

### over-composed perfection
A bit of mess is fine. Real tables have crumbs. Real streets have people half in shot. Don't make everything perfect — make it real.

## technical notes

### format
Landscape preferred for most shots. Portrait for mobile-friendly features. Square for some social uses. Shoot landscape and crop if needed.

### resolution
Minimum 2000px on longest edge for web use. Shoot higher and resize down.

### file format
Submit as high-quality JPEG. Keep RAW files in case we need to reprocess.

### naming
Name files descriptively: `wheelers-oyster-bar-exterior-winter.jpg` not `IMG_4582.jpg`.

### metadata
Include location and date taken. This helps us organise and update.

## sourcing photos

### our own shots
Priority. We take photos ourselves when possible. More control, more consistency.

### commissioned photographers
For specific shoots (e.g., a shop profile), we may commission a local photographer. They should read this guide first.

### community contributions
Locals sometimes offer their photos. Great — but they need to match the style. We don't use everything offered.

### never stock photos
Never. If we can't get a real photo, we wait until we can. Stock photos undermine everything we're trying to do.

## the test

Look at a photo and ask: could this be anywhere, or is it unmistakably Whitstable?

If it could be a generic seaside town, a random café, a stock "British coast" image — don't use it.

Every photo should feel specific to this place.
