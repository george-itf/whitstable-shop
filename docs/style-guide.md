# whitstable.shop editorial style guide

This is how we write. Every piece of content on whitstable.shop should feel like it came from the same person — someone who lives here, loves it, and wants to share it honestly.

---

## tone

### warm but not gushing
We like these places. We're not trying to sell them. There's a difference between genuine enthusiasm and breathless promotion. We sound like someone recommending a spot to a friend, not someone being paid to write copy.

**yes:** "The crab sandwich is properly good — thick chunks of white meat, not that processed stuff."
**no:** "Prepare yourself for the most INCREDIBLE crab sandwich you've ever tasted!"

### honest but not mean
We acknowledge when something isn't perfect. We don't trash places. If somewhere has issues, we mention them matter-of-factly and move on. If somewhere is genuinely bad, we just don't include it.

**yes:** "Service can be slow when they're busy, but nobody's in a rush here anyway."
**no:** "The service is absolutely atrocious and the staff couldn't care less."

### local but not gatekeeping
We know things visitors don't. We share that knowledge generously. We're not trying to keep Whitstable a secret or make tourists feel unwelcome. We're helping people have a better time here.

**yes:** "Locals tend to go on weekday mornings when it's quieter."
**no:** "You'll never experience the REAL Whitstable unless you've lived here for years."

### knowledgeable but not pretentious
We know our oysters. We don't need to prove it. Drop knowledge naturally, not showily. Explain things people might not know without being condescending.

**yes:** "Native oysters are in season September to April — they're smaller, more intense, more expensive."
**no:** "Any true connoisseur knows that only native Ostrea edulis are worth consuming."

### opinionated but fair
We have preferences. We state them. We don't pretend everything is equally good. But we're fair — we explain why we think what we think, and we acknowledge when something isn't for us but might be for others.

**yes:** "I prefer Wheeler's for the atmosphere, but the Oyster Company has better views."
**no:** "Wheeler's is the only place worth going." / "They're all good in their own way."

## language rules

### lowercase headings
All headings on whitstable.shop are lowercase. It's part of the visual identity. The only exception is proper nouns (Whitstable, The Sportsman, etc.).

**yes:** the honest seafood guide
**no:** The Honest Seafood Guide

### no exclamation marks
Almost never. They make us sound like a tourist board or a children's TV presenter. If something is exciting, the words should convey that. The odd exception for genuine surprise or a direct quote.

**yes:** "It's genuinely one of the best meals you can have in Kent."
**no:** "It's genuinely one of the best meals you can have in Kent!"

### banned phrases
These are dead to us:
- "hidden gem" — everything's a hidden gem now, the phrase means nothing
- "best kept secret" — if it's on a website, it's not a secret
- "nestled" — no place is nestled anywhere
- "boasts" — buildings don't boast
- "whether you're... or..." — lazy construction
- "something for everyone" — meaningless
- "a must-visit" — we don't tell people what they must do
- "you won't be disappointed" — we can't promise that
- "charming seaside town" — just say Whitstable
- "world-famous" — even if technically true, it sounds like marketing

### contractions always
We write like people talk. "It's" not "it is". "Don't" not "do not". "We're" not "we are". The only exception is for emphasis.

**yes:** "It's not the cheapest, but you won't regret it."
**no:** "It is not the cheapest, but you will not regret it."

### specific over vague
Details prove you've been there. Vague praise could be written about anywhere. Name the dish, name the person, name the time.

**yes:** "The smoked cod's roe on sourdough toast, served with a wedge of lemon and a pile of pickled shallots."
**no:** "The starters are excellent."

### moderate praise
Real enthusiasm doesn't need superlatives. Say "good" not "amazing". Say "great" not "incredible". Say "one of the best" not "the best in the world". The exception is when something genuinely is exceptional — then the contrast makes it land.

**yes:** "It's really good." / "This is genuinely exceptional."
**no:** "It's absolutely amazing and incredible and the best thing ever."

## what we don't do

### we don't write for SEO at the expense of readability
Yes, we want people to find us. No, we won't stuff keywords or write unnatural sentences to please algorithms. The content comes first. If it's good, people will share it.

### we don't pretend everywhere is great
Some places are average. Some are overpriced. Some coast on reputation. If we include somewhere, we'll be honest about it. If somewhere's genuinely not good, we simply don't feature it.

### we don't hide behind "it depends"
Sometimes things do depend on circumstances. But we still take a position. "It depends on what you're after" is fine if followed by "but if I had to pick one, I'd go with..."

### we don't write like a tourist board
Tourist boards have to be diplomatic. They can't criticise local businesses. They have to use phrases like "award-winning" and "renowned". We don't have those constraints. We write like humans.

### we don't use stock photo language
If you've seen the phrase on a hotel website, don't use it. "Stunning views", "warm hospitality", "culinary delights" — these are dead phrases that mean nothing.

## what we do

### we have opinions
We'll tell you which place we prefer. We'll tell you what to order. We'll tell you when to go and when to avoid. We take positions because taking positions is useful.

### we give specific recommendations
Not "there are many great places to eat" but "go to Wheeler's for oysters, the Sportsman if you're celebrating, JoJo's if you want meze and don't mind the wait".

### we acknowledge downsides
Everywhere has them. Mentioning them builds trust. "The queue can be brutal" or "it's not cheap" or "the service is a bit chaotic" — these make our praise more credible.

### we write like locals
Because we are. We use the words locals use. We know the shortcuts, the timings, the quirks. That knowledge comes through in how we write.

### we update when things change
Content isn't static. Places close, standards slip, new spots open. We keep things current. If something's out of date, we fix it or remove it.

---

## formatting

### paragraphs
Keep them short. Three to four sentences max. Single-sentence paragraphs are fine for emphasis.

### lists
Use them when listing things. Don't use them for prose that should be paragraphs.

### headings
Use them to break up long pieces. Make them useful — someone should be able to scan headings and know what's in each section.

### links
Link to relevant content elsewhere on the site. Don't overdo it — one or two per section is plenty.

### images
Every shop story and area guide should have images. See the photography guide for what we're looking for.

## the test

Before publishing anything, read it aloud. Does it sound like a real person talking to a friend? Or does it sound like marketing copy?

If there's any doubt, rewrite.
