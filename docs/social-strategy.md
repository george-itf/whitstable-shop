# Social Media Strategy

A practical guide to building whitstable.shop's social presence and community.

---

## Platform Strategy

### Primary: Instagram (@whitstable.shop)

**Why Instagram**:
- Visual platform suits shop/food content
- Strong local community engagement
- Stories for real-time updates
- Reels for reach and discovery

**Target Audience**:
- Whitstable visitors (day-trippers, tourists)
- Local residents
- Shop owners
- Food/lifestyle enthusiasts

### Secondary: Facebook

**Why Facebook**:
- Reach older demographics
- Local groups are active
- Events integration
- Business-friendly features

**Approach**: Repurpose Instagram content, engage in local groups

### Not Priority (Yet)

- **Twitter/X**: Lower local engagement
- **TikTok**: Resource-intensive, future consideration
- **LinkedIn**: Not relevant for B2C local

## Content Pillars

### 1. Shop Spotlights (40%)

Feature one shop with engaging content.

**Format**:
- High-quality photo (theirs or original)
- Shop name and what they do
- What makes them special
- One specific recommendation (try their X)
- Link to their whitstable.shop profile

**Example Post**:
> 📚 OXFORD STREET BOOKS
>
> Whitstable's beloved independent bookshop has been a high street staple for over 20 years.
>
> The kind of place where you'll lose an hour browsing, leave with three books you didn't plan to buy, and somehow feel great about it.
>
> Staff pick: "Ask them for a local recommendation"
>
> 📍 42 Oxford Street
> 🔗 whitstable.shop/shop/oxford-street-books

**Frequency**: 2-3 per week

>
> Saturday: 11:23am & 11:47pm

> Low tide = more beach, rock pools, and easier oyster hunting!
>
