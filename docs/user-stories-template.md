## "my whitstable" series

Interviews with people who live here. Not business owners being promotional — regular people sharing their actual routines and opinions.

### the format

**[Name], [how long they've lived here]**

A conversational Q&A that captures their personal relationship with Whitstable. 500-800 words.

### the questions

1. **How did you end up in Whitstable?**
   Let them tell the story. Born here? Moved for work? Escaped London? Followed a partner? Each story is different.

2. **What's your typical Saturday?**
   Walk us through it. When do you wake up? Where do you go for coffee? Do you go to the market? What's lunch? This reveals more than asking "what are your favourite places?"

3. **Where do you take visitors?**
   The spots they're proud to show off. Often different from their everyday spots.

4. **What do visitors always get wrong?**
   The misconceptions. The tourist traps people fall for. The things that make locals roll their eyes.

5. **What's your Whitstable unpopular opinion?**
   The spicy one. Something they think that might be controversial. The place everyone loves that they think is overrated. The thing nobody talks about that they love. This is often the most interesting answer.

6. **What would you change?**
   Nothing's perfect. What frustrates them? What do they wish was different? This keeps it real.

7. **Why do you stay?**
   The heart of it. What keeps them here? What would make them leave?

### how to conduct the interview

- In person if possible, over coffee or a pint
- Voice memo and transcribe — more natural than typed answers
- Let them ramble, edit later
- Follow interesting tangents
- Don't include every question if some answers are weak
- Get their permission to publish, ideally in writing

### example interview

**Sarah, 8 years**

*How did you end up in Whitstable?*

Classic DFL story, really. I was living in Peckham, burnt out from a job in advertising, and a friend dragged me here for a birthday weekend. It was February, absolutely freezing, and I just... got it. Within a year I'd quit my job and moved here. Rented a tiny flat on Island Wall that cost less than my parking permit in London.

*What's your typical Saturday?*

Up early because I never broke the habit. Frank for coffee around 8 — it's quiet then, you can actually get a seat. Walk along the beach if the tide's right. Market if I need anything, but honestly I avoid it in summer now because it's chaos. Lunch is usually whatever's in the fridge. Afternoon depends — sometimes I work, sometimes I walk to Seasalter and back. Evening is either the Neppy if the weather's good or cooking at home.

*What do visitors always get wrong?*

They think you need a car. You don't. If you drive, you spend half the day looking for parking and the other half sitting in traffic on the way home. Get the train. It's an hour from St Pancras, there's a pub right outside the station, and you can walk everywhere.

Also, everyone queues at the same three places and misses the better stuff two streets away. But I'm not complaining — keeps my spots quieter.

*What's your Whitstable unpopular opinion?*

JoJo's is fine but it's not worth a two-hour wait. There, I said it. The food is good, the vibe is nice, but there are three other places I'd go first. People treat it like it's the only restaurant in town.

*Why do you stay?*

I can see the sea from my kitchen window. I can walk to everything I need. I know my neighbours. My commute is a walk across the beach to a café where I work for a few hours. I earn less than I did in London but I spend less and I'm happier. Simple as that.

## "first visit" series

Stories from visitors about their Whitstable experience. Useful perspective for others planning their first trip.

### the format

**[Name], visiting from [where]**

Their first-timer experience. 300-500 words.

### the questions

1. **Why Whitstable?**
   What made them choose it? Recommendation? Instagram? Article? Oyster obsession?

2. **What did you do?**
   The itinerary. What they ate, where they went, what they saw.

3. **What surprised you?**
   Expectations vs reality. What was different from what they expected?

4. **What would you do differently?**
   Hindsight advice. The mistakes they made that others can avoid.

5. **What did you wish you'd known?**
   The practical stuff. The tide times, the parking situation, the need to book.

6. **Will you come back?**
   And if so, what would they do differently next time?

### example visit story

**Marcus, visiting from Birmingham**

*Why Whitstable?*

My partner's obsessed with oysters and I'd promised her a birthday trip somewhere on the coast. Someone at work mentioned Whitstable and when I googled it, it looked perfect — small, pretty, all about seafood.

*What did you do?*

Arrived Saturday lunchtime. Big mistake — the car park was rammed and we spent 40 minutes finding a spot. Finally ate around 2pm at the Lobster Shack on the beach. Walked along the harbour, had oysters at Wheeler's (queued for an hour), drinks at the Old Neptune. Sunday was calmer — coffee at that place Frank, walked to Tankerton, sat on the Slopes. Left around 3pm before traffic.

*What would you do differently?*

Get the train. Definitely get the train. Also, we should have booked dinner somewhere — we ended up eating fish and chips on a bench because everywhere was full.

*What did you wish you'd known?*

That everything closes or gets impossible after about 6pm on a Saturday. We assumed we'd just wander and find somewhere for dinner. Nope.

*Will you come back?*

Already planning it. November, off-peak train, two nights in a B&B, booking The Sportsman which apparently you need to reserve months ahead.

- Honest, including criticisms
- Specific, with real details
- In the person's own voice (don't over-edit)
- Useful to readers planning their own visit
- Consistent with our overall style guide

If someone's story is too promotional, too vague, or too negative to be useful, politely decline to publish it. Not everything makes the cut.
