A practical guide to help Whitstable shop owners improve their online visibility and attract more customers.

## Why Local SEO Matters

When people search "coffee shops Whitstable" or "gift shops near me", local SEO determines which businesses appear first. Good local SEO means:

- **More visibility** in Google search and maps
- **More foot traffic** from people searching nearby
- **Better information** so customers know when you're open
- **Trust signals** from reviews and consistent information

---

## Step 1: Claim Your Google Business Profile

This is the single most important thing you can do for local SEO.

### How to Claim

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
2. Search for your business name
3. Click "Claim this business" or "Add your business"
4. Verify via postcard, phone, or email

### Optimise Your Profile

- [ ] **Business name**: Exact legal name (no keyword stuffing)
- [ ] **Category**: Choose the most accurate primary category
- [ ] **Address**: Exact address matching other listings
- [ ] **Phone**: Local phone number
- [ ] **Hours**: Keep updated, including bank holidays
- [ ] **Description**: 750 characters describing your business
- [ ] **Photos**: Add 10+ high-quality photos
- [ ] **Products/Services**: List what you offer

### Keep It Active

- Post weekly updates (events, new products, offers)
- Respond to all reviews (positive and negative)
- Update hours for special occasions
- Add new photos regularly

---

## Step 2: Consistency Across Platforms

Search engines trust businesses that show consistent information everywhere.

### NAP Consistency

**NAP = Name, Address, Phone**

Your NAP should be identical on:
- Google Business Profile
- whitstable.shop
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Your website
- Yelp/TripAdvisor
- Local directories

### Example of Consistency

**Correct** (identical everywhere):
> The Cheese Box
> 25 Harbour Street
> Whitstable, Kent CT5 1AH
> 01227 273456

**Incorrect** (variations cause confusion):
> The Cheese Box Ltd (different name)
> 25 Harbour St (abbreviated)
> Whitstable CT5 1AH (missing county)
> 01227-273456 (different format)

## Step 3: Encourage Customer Reviews

Reviews are crucial for local SEO rankings and customer trust.

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- Ask satisfied customers to leave reviews
- Make it easy (QR code at till, link in email receipts)
- Respond to all reviews professionally
- Thank positive reviewers
- Address negative reviews constructively

**Don't:**
- Offer incentives for reviews (against guidelines)
- Write fake reviews
- Ask only happy customers
- Ignore negative feedback

### How to Ask

> "If you enjoyed your visit, we'd love if you could leave us a review on Google or whitstable.shop. It really helps other customers find us!"

### Responding to Negative Reviews

```
"Thank you for your feedback, [Name]. We're sorry to hear about your
experience with [specific issue]. We'd like to make this right -
please contact us at [email/phone] so we can discuss further.
We appreciate you bringing this to our attention."
```
