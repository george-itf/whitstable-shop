# Shop Owner Letter

---

Dear Shop Owner,

I hope this letter finds you between customers.

I'm writing to let you know about **whitstable.shop** — a new website I've built for our town. It's a simple idea: one place where locals and visitors can find all of Whitstable's independent shops, cafés, and restaurants.

**Your business is already listed.** I've added your opening hours, address, and a description based on what I know. But you know your shop better than anyone, so I'd love you to check it and make any changes.

## Why does this exist?

Whitstable's high street is special. We have butchers, bakers, bookshops, and galleries that have been here for generations. But when someone searches online, they usually end up on Google or TripAdvisor — platforms that don't really understand what makes a place like ours tick.

whitstable.shop is different. It's built specifically for Whitstable. No algorithms deciding who gets seen. No paid listings. Just a straightforward directory of local businesses, with honest reviews from real people.

## What does it cost?

Nothing. It's free. There's no catch.

## What should you do?

1. **Visit your listing:** Scan the QR code below or go to whitstable.shop/shops/your-shop-name
2. **Claim your shop:** Click "Claim this shop" and verify you're the owner
3. **Update your details:** Add your own description, upload photos, update hours

That's it. Takes about five minutes.

If you have any questions, just email hello@whitstable.shop and I'll get back to you.

Thanks for being part of what makes Whitstable brilliant.

Best wishes,

*[Your name]*
