## Post 1: Announcement

**Image suggestion:** Simple branded image with whitstable.shop logo, or photo of Whitstable High Street/harbour

**Caption:**

We've built something for Whitstable.

whitstable.shop is a simple directory of our town's independent shops, cafés, and restaurants. One place to find what's open, what's good, and what's on.

No algorithms. No ads. Just Whitstable.

## Post 2: Did You Know — Wheeler's

**Image suggestion:** Photo of Wheeler's Oyster Bar (exterior)

**Caption:**

Did you know Wheeler's Oyster Bar has been serving oysters since 1856? That's four generations of the Wheeler family, same tiny pink building on the High Street.

No bookings, no fuss — just queue and wait. The seafood platter is legendary.

## Post 3: Shop Spotlight — Oxford Street Books

One of our favourite Whitstable shops: Oxford Street Books.

Proper indie bookshop vibes — teetering piles, handwritten recommendations, and staff who actually read. Strong local history section and an excellent children's corner.

## Post 9: The Sportsman

**Image suggestion:** Photo of The Sportsman pub exterior or marsh views

**Caption:**

Technically in Seasalter, but no Whitstable guide is complete without The Sportsman.

Michelin star since 2008. Unassuming pub on the marshes. Exceptional food. Stephen Harris is a legend.

Book well ahead. Months ahead for special occasions.

## Tone Guidelines

**Do:**
- Sound like a local who cares
- Be warm but not gushing
- Use simple, direct language
- Include specific details about shops
- Celebrate without overselling

**Don't:**
- Sound corporate or marketing-speak
- Use excessive emojis (one or two max per post)
- Use hollow superlatives ("amazing", "incredible", "stunning")
- Try too hard to be cool or trendy
- Forget to include the website link
