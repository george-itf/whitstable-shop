## What to Know in an Emergency

When calling 999, be ready to provide:
- Your location (as precisely as possible)
- What has happened
- How many people are involved
- Any injuries
- Your phone number

Stay on the line until the operator tells you to hang up. If you can't speak, listen to the operator's instructions — there are systems to help.
