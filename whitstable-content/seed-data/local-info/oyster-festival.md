# Whitstable Oyster Festival

## History

The Whitstable Oyster Festival celebrates the town's historic connection to oyster fishing, which dates back to Roman times. The native oyster (*Ostrea edulis*) has been harvested from beds just offshore for over 2,000 years.

The modern festival began in 1984, reviving a tradition that had lapsed when oyster stocks declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since then, it's grown into one of Kent's biggest annual events, attracting tens of thousands of visitors each year.

## When Is It?

The festival traditionally runs for **one week in late July**, timed around St James's Day (25th July) — the patron saint of oysters.
