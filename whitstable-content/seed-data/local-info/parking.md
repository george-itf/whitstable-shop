## Tips for Finding a Space

1. **Arrive early** — Gorrell Tank often fills by 10am on weekends
2. **Try Cromwell Road first** — It often has spaces when Gorrell is full
3. **Park further out** — A 10-minute walk saves frustration
4. **Check return time** — Spaces open up as people leave
5. **Consider the train** — Might be less stressful

## Parking Enforcement

Don't risk it. Pay for parking and check the signs.
