# Tide Times in Whitstable

## Understanding the Tides

Whitstable sits on the Thames Estuary, which has some of the largest tidal ranges in the UK. The difference between high and low tide can be up to 5 metres, dramatically changing the character of the beach and harbour throughout the day.

## Where to Check Tide Times

For accurate, daily tide times:

- **Official source:** [tidetimes.org.uk/whitstable-tide-times](https://tidetimes.org.uk/whitstable-tide-times)
- **BBC Weather:** Search "Whitstable tides"
- **Magic Seaweed:** Good for wind and swell too

The harbour masters also display tide times on notice boards around the harbour.

## The Street

Whitstable's famous shingle spit — known as "The Street" — is a natural causeway that extends about half a mile into the sea. It's only visible at low tide and is one of the town's most distinctive features.

### When to Walk The Street

- Visible from about **2 hours before low tide** to **2 hours after**
- Best walking conditions at low tide itself
- Check tide times and plan your walk accordingly

### Safety on The Street

- **Never** walk out as the tide is coming in — it comes in fast
- The shingle can be slippery, especially with seaweed
- Wear sturdy footwear (no flip-flops)
- Keep an eye on the water — it can surround you quickly
- If you see the water covering the path behind you, head back immediately

## Beach Access by Tide

### High Tide
- Beach is narrow or non-existent in places
- Sea wall promenade remains accessible
- Best time for: watching waves, atmosphere at the Neptune

### Low Tide
- Wide expanses of sand and shingle revealed
- Rock pools appear
- Best time for: walking, beachcombing, The Street, letting dogs run

## Swimming and Paddling

- The water is shallow for a long way out at low tide
- Swimming is easier around high tide (deeper water)
- Check for jellyfish in summer
- The water is tidal estuary — not as clear as open coast

## Fishing and Crabbing

- Best crabbing from the harbour wall at high tide
- Fishing from the beach works at various states
- Check local bylaws for any restrictions

## Oyster Beds

At low tide you can see the oyster beds offshore. These are working fisheries — please don't disturb them or take anything.

## Tide-Related Events

- **Spring tides** (around new and full moons): More extreme highs and lows
- **Neap tides** (around quarter moons): Less dramatic range
- Storm surges can add extra height to high tides — check warnings

## Emergency Information

- Stay calm
- Call 999 and ask for the Coastguard
- Wave to attract attention
- If possible, move to higher ground
