# Beach Information

## Overview

Whitstable's beach stretches for miles along the north Kent coast, from Seasalter in the west to Tankerton in the east. It's a shingle beach (pebbles, not sand), backed by groynes and sea walls. The beach is free, open year-round, and managed by Canterbury City Council.

## Beach Areas

### West Beach
- Runs from the harbour westward toward Seasalter
- Quieter than the central beaches
- Popular with dog walkers
- Some beach huts
- Access via Marine Drive and Sea Wall

### Harbour Beach / Town Beach
- Either side of the harbour
- Busiest area
- Close to pubs, cafés, and shops
- Good for watching fishing boats
- The Old Neptune pub sits right on the beach here

### Tankerton Beach
- East of the harbour, below Tankerton Slopes
- Generally less crowded
- Family-friendly
- Famous for "The Street" shingle spit (visible at low tide)
- Beach huts line the promenade

## Water Quality

Whitstable beaches are generally clean and meet Environment Agency standards. For current water quality ratings:

- Check the [Environment Agency's Swimfo website](https://environment.data.gov.uk/bwq/profiles/)
- Search for "Whitstable" or "Tankerton"

**Note:** Water quality can be affected by rainfall (storm drains) — avoid swimming for 24-48 hours after heavy rain.

## Swimming

The beach is safe for paddling and swimming, with some considerations:

- **Water is shallow** at low tide — you'll walk a long way before it's deep
- **Better for swimming** around high tide
- **Currents** can be present — don't go too far out
- **No designated swimming zone** — watch for boats near the harbour
- **Jellyfish** appear in summer (mostly harmless compass and moon jellies)
- **Water temperature** is bracing even in summer (typically 15-18°C peak)

## Dog Rules

Dogs are welcome on Whitstable beaches with some seasonal restrictions.

### May 1 – September 30
- **Dogs prohibited** on the beach between:
