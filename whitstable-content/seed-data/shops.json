    "description": "A proper Whitstable institution. Four generations of the Wheeler family have served oysters from this tiny pink-painted cottage on the High Street. No bookings, no fuss — just queue up and wait for a seat at the counter.\n\nThe seafood platter is legendary, piled high with oysters, crab, prawns and whatever's fresh that morning. The place is tiny — maybe a dozen seats — so expect to wait, especially on weekends. But that's part of the charm. Bring your own wine (no corkage) and settle in for a proper Whitstable experience.\n\nDon't miss the crab soup if it's on. And yes, the pink paint is deliberate — it's been that colour for as long as anyone can remember.",

    "description": "Buy fish straight from the boats. The small fishmarket on the harbour sells whatever's been landed that morning — sea bass, sole, mackerel, crab, lobster, whelks. It's about as fresh as fish gets.\n\nPrices are excellent compared to supermarkets. The fishmongers can advise on cooking and will prep fish however you want. Get there early for the best selection.\n\nReal Whitstable, working harbour stuff. Worth a visit even if you're not buying just to see what comes in.",

The framing service is handy.\n\nBright, well-organised shop. Friendly staff. Nice place to find a print of somewhere you've visited that day.",

It's the gardens that are the real draw — especially the walled garden.\n\nFree to visit the gardens. Nice for a wander away from the shops.",
