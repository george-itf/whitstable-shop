# the tide times explainer

Tides matter in Whitstable more than in most seaside towns. The Street appears and disappears. The beach changes completely. The harbour looks different. Understanding tides makes your visit better.

## why they matter

**The Street:** This shingle spit runs out from Tankerton beach toward the horizon. At high tide, it's underwater and invisible. At low tide, you can walk out on it for hundreds of meters. If you've come specifically to experience The Street, you need low tide.

**The beaches:** At high tide, the beach is narrower — the water comes up to the sea wall in places. At low tide, the beach expands dramatically. More space, more walking room, different views.

**The harbour:** At high tide, boats float and the water laps the walls. At low tide, boats sit on the mud at angles. Both have their charm, but they're very different atmospheres.

**Coastal walks:** Some routes along the shore are only walkable at low tide. At high tide, you might need to go inland or turn back.

## how to read them

Tide times are published online and in local papers. Search "Whitstable tide times" and you'll find predictions for any date.

**Key terms:**

*High tide* — Water is at its highest point. The exact time is listed.

*Low tide* — Water is at its lowest point. Usually about 6 hours after high tide.

*Tidal range* — How much difference between high and low. This varies throughout the month.

*Spring tides* — Extreme tides (very high highs, very low lows). Happen around new and full moons.

*Neap tides* — Moderate tides. Less dramatic range.

**For The Street:** You want low tide, ideally a spring low tide for maximum exposure. Check times in advance and plan your visit around them.

**For general beach time:** Low tide gives more space. High tide gives more water views. Neither is wrong.

## the mudflats warning

At very low tide, areas of the harbour and shore become mudflats. This looks like beach but isn't.

**Don't walk on mudflats.** They can be surprisingly deep. People get stuck. Rescue is embarrassing at best, dangerous at worst.

The shingle and sand is fine. The grey-brown mud that appears when the water goes out — stay off it.

This is particularly relevant to children who might wander, and to photographers chasing shots without checking footing.

## sunset + high tide combinations

For the most dramatic harbour views, timing sunset with high tide creates something special. Water up against the walls, golden light on the waves, boats floating on reflected sky.

**How to plan this:**
1. Find the sunset time for your date (search online)
2. Find the tide times for the same date
3. Look for days when high tide falls within an hour of sunset

This doesn't happen every day. But when it does, the harbour at that moment is exceptional.

The harbour arm walk at sunset during high tide is as good as Whitstable gets visually.

## practical tide planning

**For a first visit:**
Check tide times in advance. If possible, time arrival to experience both — maybe arrive at low tide for The Street, stay until the water comes back.

**For The Street specifically:**
You need low tide. Check times. Plan to be at Tankerton 1-2 hours either side of the low point.

**For general visits:**
Don't stress too much. Both tides are interesting. But if you have strong preferences (swimming vs beach walking), check times.

**Weather and tides combined:**
A winter storm at high tide means waves crashing over the sea wall. Dramatic but wet. A calm summer evening at low tide means maximum beach space. Plan for what you want.

## the honest summary

Tides are free entertainment and essential information. Five minutes of checking can transform your visit — getting The Street at the right moment, swimming at the right time, seeing the harbour at its most atmospheric.

Low tide for The Street and beach space. High tide for swimming and harbour drama. Sunset at high tide for maximum visual impact.

The tides wait for no one, so plan around them rather than hoping they'll fit your schedule.
