# the dog owners' guide

Whitstable is a dog town. You'll notice immediately — dogs on the beach, dogs in pubs, dogs tied up outside shops while owners grab coffee. If you're bringing a dog, you're welcome. Here's what you need to know.

## which beaches, which times of year

The main rule: check for seasonal restrictions, which exist on some beaches during summer months.

**Tankerton Beach:**
- Generally dog-friendly
- Some restrictions may apply in peak summer on certain sections
- Check signage on arrival

**West Beach:**
- The dog walker's beach
- Fewer restrictions
- More space, less crowded
- The walk toward Seasalter is prime dog territory

**Harbour area:**
- Dogs allowed on the harbour and shingle
- Gets crowded in summer, which affects dog enjoyment
- Early morning or off-season is better

**General principle:**
- Winter (October–March): dogs basically everywhere, no problems
- Summer: some restrictions on some beaches during the day
- Early morning and evening: usually fine regardless
- Check local signage for current rules

## dog-friendly pubs (actually friendly, not just "allowed")

Some pubs tolerate dogs. Some genuinely welcome them. The difference matters.

**The Neptune:**
- Properly dog-friendly
- Water bowls often available
- Regulars bring their dogs constantly
- The beach location means sandy, salty dogs are expected

**The Duke of Cumberland:**
- Local's pub, dogs are part of the furniture
- Regulars know each other's dogs by name

**The Tankerton Arms:**
- Welcomes dogs, especially in the garden
- The Slopes walking crowd comes with dogs

**General pub advice:**
- Call ahead if you're concerned
- Some pubs have "dogs in the bar but not the restaurant" rules
- Well-behaved dogs under control are welcome almost everywhere
- Clean up any accidents, obviously

## the walking routes

**West Beach to Seasalter:**
- The classic. Along the beach or coastal path.
- About 2 miles each way.
- Plenty of space for off-lead running.
- Other dogs to meet.
- Can loop back via roads or retrace.

**The Slopes and Tankerton Beach:**
- The grassy Slopes for running around.
- Beach access from there.
- The Street at low tide (keep dogs under control around other walkers).
- Good for a shorter outing.

**The harbour and town:**
- Not really a "walk" but dogs are welcome.
- Pop into dog-friendly shops.
- The harbour shingle for sniffing and exploring.

**Island Wall and backstreets:**
- On-lead urban walking.
- Exploring the residential character.

## the water bowls map

This changes as businesses come and go, but generally:

- Most dog-friendly pubs put bowls out
- Some cafés have bowls outside
- Shops sometimes keep bowls at their doors
- The Neptune almost always has water available
- If in doubt, ask — most places are happy to provide

Carrying your own water and collapsible bowl is sensible, especially on beach walks.

## the unofficial dog beach

West Beach toward Seasalter functions as the unofficial dog beach. Not officially designated, but in practice, this is where people bring dogs to run, swim, and be dogs.

In the mornings, you'll see the regulars — same dogs, same owners, same routes. It's a social scene as much as a walk.

If your dog likes to swim, the beach here is good for it — reasonably clean, not too busy, space to get in and out.

## practical tips

**Poo bags:** Bring them. Use them. Bins are available along the beaches and in town.

**Lead control:** Off-lead is possible on beaches outside restricted periods, but read your dog and the situation. Not all dogs appreciate an overenthusiastic stranger.

**Cafés and restaurants:** Generally dogs are fine at outdoor seating. Inside is variable — ask first.

**Hot weather:** The shingle gets hot in full summer sun. Early morning or evening is better for paws.

**The sea:** Dogs can swim, the water is reasonably clean, but rinse off afterwards if you can — salt and sand aren't great for coats.

**Other dogs:** Whitstable dogs are generally socialised, but not all dogs want to make friends. Normal etiquette applies.

## the dog-friendly day

A sample day with a dog:

**Morning:**
- Early walk on West Beach before it gets busy
- Coffee at a dog-friendly café (outside seating)

**Midday:**
- Explore the harbour area
- Lunch at a pub garden

**Afternoon:**
- Walk on the Slopes
- The Street if tide is right

**Evening:**
- Pint at the Neptune, dog at feet
- Dinner at a dog-friendly pub or restaurant with outdoor space

## the honest summary

Whitstable is one of the more dog-friendly places you can visit. The beach access (with some seasonal limits), the pub culture, the general attitude — dogs are part of the town's fabric.

The trade-off is being responsible. Clean up. Control your dog. Don't let them harass other beach-goers. The welcome depends on dog owners not abusing it.

Bring your dog. Enjoy the walks. Use the pubs. Just be the kind of owner that keeps Whitstable dog-friendly for everyone.
