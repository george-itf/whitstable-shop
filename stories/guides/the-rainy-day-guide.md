# the rainy day guide

It's going to rain. This is the English coast. Having a plan B is essential. Here's what to do when the weather turns.

## what to do when the weather turns

First: rain doesn't have to ruin your day. Whitstable in the rain has its own atmosphere — grey sea, dramatic skies, empty beaches. A waterproof and the right attitude transforms weather from problem to feature.

But if you really want to be indoors, here are the options.

## the covered spots

**The pubs** — Obvious but correct. The Neptune with rain on the windows is excellent. Any pub with a fire is better in bad weather than good.

**The restaurants** — Wheeler's, Samphire, the Oyster Company. Have a long lunch. Order wine. Let the weather happen outside.

**The cafés** — Frank, The Forge, the various cafés with enough seating. Coffee and cake while rain drums on the window.

**The galleries** — Fishslab Gallery on the harbour, smaller galleries around town. Art requires rain anyway.

**The shops** — Oxford Street Books, The Cheese Box, the vintage and antique shops. Browsing is a rainy day activity.

## the pubs with fireplaces

When it's genuinely cold and wet, a fire makes the difference:

**The Neptune** — The classic choice. Storm watching from inside, fire going, pint in hand.

**The Duke of Cumberland** — Local's pub on Island Wall. Less famous, equally cosy.

**The Tankerton Arms** — Up on the hill, hunkering down weather.

**The Pearson's Arms** — Sea views with warmth.

Call ahead if fires are essential to your plan — not all pubs light them all the time, and some only in proper winter.

## the galleries worth your time

**Fishslab Gallery** — Contemporary art in the old fish market building on the harbour. Changing exhibitions, always interesting.

**The smaller galleries** — Check what's on. Various spaces around town show work.

**The Horsebridge Centre** — Community arts venue with exhibitions and events. Worth checking the program.

Gallery browsing takes an hour or two. Combine with pub or café for a full rainy afternoon.

## canterbury as a backup

Canterbury is 30 minutes away by car, 20 by train from Faversham. If Whitstable's weather is too grim, Canterbury offers:

**The cathedral** — Obviously. One of the great English cathedrals. Can fill hours.

**The town centre** — Covered shopping streets, historic buildings, café culture.

**Museums** — The Canterbury Tales, the Roman museum, various small museums.

**Pubs and restaurants** — Indoor eating options beyond Whitstable's range.

This is the nuclear option — if Whitstable weather is genuinely hopeless and you need to salvage the day, Canterbury is the escape.

But don't default to it too quickly. Rainy Whitstable has its own appeal. Walking along the harbour arm in drizzle, retreating to a pub for lunch, exploring shops you'd have skipped in sunshine — this is valid.

## embracing the weather

The honest advice: some of the best Whitstable experiences happen in bad weather.

**The beach walk in wind and rain** — When the coast shows its dramatic side. The waves, the spray, the sense of being on the edge of something.

**The Neptune in a storm** — The pub exists because of this weather. Watching the sea hit the wall while warm and dry is the whole point.

**The morning after a storm** — Beach debris, strange light, the town washed clean.

**Off-season empty beaches** — What rain gives you is space. No crowds. The landscape to yourself.

The gear matters. A proper waterproof jacket, shoes that don't care about wet shingle. If you're equipped, weather becomes atmosphere rather than inconvenience.

## the rainy day itinerary

**Morning:**
- Coffee at Frank (dry start)
- Browse Oxford Street shops and bookshop
- Galleries if open

**Lunch:**
- Proper sit-down meal somewhere. Wheeler's, Samphire. Use the weather as excuse for the long lunch you wanted anyway.

**Afternoon:**
- Beach walk if the rain eases — waterproofs on
- Pub if the rain persists — fire on
- More browsing if you're not pub people

**Evening:**
- Dinner (book ahead)
- Or pub (no booking required)

## the honest summary

Rain shouldn't cancel a Whitstable visit. It changes it. The indoor options are good — pubs, restaurants, shops, galleries. The outdoor experience in rain can be excellent if you're equipped for it.

The worst option is staying in your accommodation resenting the weather. The best option is embracing it — waterproof walking, cosy pubs, long lunches, browsing.

Canterbury is there if you really need an escape. But try Whitstable in the rain first. You might find it's better than expected.
