# VC Jones: fish and chips

Every seaside town needs a proper chippy. VC Jones is Whitstable's answer — a fish and chip shop that takes the basics seriously and resists the temptation to overcomplicate things.

The queue on a Friday night tells you everything you need to know.

## the origin story

VC Jones has been here for decades, outlasting trends and fads by doing one thing well: fish and chips. While other places have come and gone, chasing the next thing, VC Jones has kept frying.

The model is classic chippie: counter service, fish from the local waters when possible, chips from potatoes, everything cooked to order. There's seating if you want it, but most people take away. This is food for the beach, the harbour wall, the walk home.

## what locals know

Friday night is mental. The queue stretches out the door and moves slower than you'd like. If you're going Friday, accept this and factor it in.

The fish specials — whatever's on that day beyond the standard cod and haddock — are often the best thing to order. Ask what's good.

Curry sauce or gravy is the eternal debate. VC Jones handles both with dignity.

Eating on the harbour wall is part of the experience. Buy the fish, walk to the water, eat with seagulls circling.

## the signature experience

A warm paper parcel of battered fish and chips, slightly too hot to eat comfortably, carried to the harbour or the beach. Salt, vinegar, the smell of the sea mixing with the smell of frying. Seagulls being aggressively interested in your meal.

This is British seaside eating at its most essential.

## a moment that captures the place

A group of teenagers on their first trip without parents, pooling cash for chips to share. An elderly couple who'd been coming here since before the kids were born. A family of four negotiating who got the last pickled onion.

The queue was democratic — everyone waiting together, everyone getting the same thing, everyone about to have the same experience. The couple at the front had ordered a single portion to share because, as the woman explained, "we don't eat like we used to."

Fish and chips is democratic food. VC Jones understands this.

## the people

The staff handle the rush with practised efficiency. This isn't a job where you linger over conversation — the queue is long, the fryers are hot, and people are hungry. But they're friendly when there's time, and they know their regulars.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** Weekday lunch for quick service and fresh batches. Midweek evenings for a proper chippy dinner without Friday chaos.

**Avoid:** Friday evening if you hate queues. Saturday lunch in summer. Any time the entire town is hungry.

**Accept:** Sometimes you queue. That's chippies.

## what to order

- **Cod and chips** — The classic. Large or regular depending on appetite.
- **Haddock** — Some prefer it. Slightly different flavour.
- **Fish special** — Whatever's on. Often the best choice.
- **Chips** — On their own if you're not that hungry. Still good.
- **Curry sauce** — If you're a curry sauce person.
- **Mushy peas** — Traditional. Bright green. Comforting.

Don't overthink it. This is fish and chips.

## the honest take

It's a chippy. The decor is functional. The seating is basic. You're not here for ambiance, you're here for fried fish.

Prices have gone up like everywhere else. Fish and chips is no longer cheap food — it's reasonably-priced food. A proper portion with sides costs real money now.

Quality varies by timing. Just-fried is better than sat-under-the-lamp. If they're cooking a fresh batch, wait for it.

And it's not fancy. If you want your fish delicately pan-fried with a wine reduction, go to a restaurant. VC Jones does battered, fried, wrapped in paper. That's the deal.

For what it is — a proper seaside chippy — it's exactly right. Not trying to be more than it should be, not cutting corners, just fish and chips done well.
