# Whitstable Brewery: local beer

There's something satisfying about drinking beer that was made in the town you're drinking it in. Whitstable Brewery makes that possible — a microbrewery producing beer for the pubs and shops of Whitstable.

The tap room is where you go to drink it at the source.

## the origin story

Whitstable Brewery started in 2003, part of the microbrewery boom that has given Britain's beer scene so much variety. The founders wanted to make beer locally, using traditional methods, and sell it to the community around them.

The brewery operates from an industrial unit that's functional rather than pretty. The tap room attached is the public face — a place to try the beers, buy bottles to take away, and experience the brewery without the marketing polish of bigger operations.

The beers appear across Whitstable's pubs and shops. The oyster stout has become something of a signature — brewed with actual oysters, appropriate for a town defined by them.

## what locals know

The tap room is the place to try beers you won't find elsewhere. Limited editions, experimental batches, things that never make it to pubs. Worth visiting for the range alone.

You can buy bottles and cans to take away. If you're renting a house for the weekend, this is your beer shop.

The location is not central — it's out toward the industrial estates, not on Harbour Street. You need to make a trip specifically, or combine it with something else in that direction.

Tours and tastings can sometimes be arranged. Check with them directly.

## the signature experience

A flight of beers at the tap room, working through different styles. The pale ale, the bitter, the porter. Discussing the differences, discovering preferences, learning what you actually like when given proper options.

Or: grabbing a mixed case to take back to the rental house, stocking the fridge with local beer for the weekend.

## a moment that captures the place

A group of friends had driven down from London. They'd read about the brewery online and made it part of their Whitstable itinerary. The bartender walked them through the options, explained the brewing process, pulled samples.

An hour later, they'd tried most of the range, bought cases for the weekend, and were debating which beer to demand at their local pub in London. "We never find stuff like this at home," one said.

"That's the point," the bartender replied. "You have to come here."

## the people

The team are enthusiasts. Brewing is their thing, not just their job. Ask about the process, the ingredients, the differences between styles — you'll get real answers from people who care.

The atmosphere is relaxed and informal. This is a tap room attached to a working brewery, not a designed hospitality experience.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** Afternoon or early evening for the tap room. When you want to stock up on local beer.

**Avoid:** Check opening hours — it's not open all the time like a regular pub.

**Plan ahead:** If you want a tour or tasting, get in touch before visiting.

## what to order

- **The flight** — Try a selection. Best way to explore.
- **Oyster Stout** — The signature. Brewed with Whitstable oysters. A talking point.
- **Whatever's on cask** — The freshest option.
- **Something experimental** — Ask what's new or unusual.
- **Takeaway** — Bottles, cans, cases. Stock up.

## the honest take

The location requires effort. It's not somewhere you'll stumble upon — you need to choose to go there. For beer enthusiasts, that's fine. For casual visitors, it might not make the itinerary.

The tap room is functional, not fancy. Industrial setting, no-frills decor. If you want a charming pub experience, go to a charming pub and order their beer.

Opening hours are limited. Check before making the journey.

And it's a microbrewery, which means production is modest. Some beers are only available at the tap room or selected local pubs. If you want to try everything, you have to come here.

For people who care about beer — who want to drink local, who want to understand what they're drinking, who want to support independent brewing — Whitstable Brewery is essential. For everyone else, it's an interesting detour if you have time.
