# Frank: coffee that takes itself seriously

Frank is the coffee shop for people who care about coffee. This sounds pretentious, and honestly, there's a fine line here — the shop manages to be serious about what it does without being insufferable about it.

The coffee is excellent. That's the point. Everything else follows from that.

## the origin story

Frank opened when the "third wave coffee" movement was still relatively new outside London. At the time, most Whitstable cafés served the same generic espresso from the same generic machines. Frank's founders decided to do it properly: single-origin beans, careful roasting, baristas who actually understood what they were doing.

The gamble was that Whitstable — full of design-conscious, quality-focused weekenders — would support a proper coffee shop. The gamble paid off.

Now there are more good coffee places in town, but Frank was there first and still sets the standard.

## what locals know

Go early. The regular crowd includes people who start their day here, every day. By 8am, the serious coffee people are already on their second cup.

The rotating single-origin options are usually more interesting than the house blend. Ask what's on and what it tastes like — the staff will explain without being condescending.

It's a good place to work. Wifi, plugs, tolerance for laptops. Not everyone wants you camping out all day, but Frank is reasonably understanding about the laptop crowd.

There's food, but it's not really a food place. The pastries are good, the breakfast stuff is solid, but you're here for the coffee. Don't come expecting an elaborate brunch menu.

## the signature experience

The flat white. Made properly. With beans roasted by someone who cares, by a barista who knows how to extract properly, in a cup that's the right size and temperature.

Sit by the window. Watch Whitstable wake up. Have a pastry. Don't rush.

This is not a complicated experience. That's the point. Good coffee, done well, in a nice space. It doesn't need to be more than that.

## a moment that captures the place

A Monday morning in November. Cold outside, warm inside. The shop was quiet — a few regulars, a couple of remote workers, someone reading the paper.

I ordered a pour-over of something Kenyan. The barista explained what to expect (bright, citrusy, tea-like body) and asked if I wanted to watch the process. I did. They talked me through the extraction while it dripped, explaining what they were looking for.

This could have been insufferable. It wasn't. It was just someone who loved their craft sharing that love with someone interested. If I hadn't been interested, they would have just made the coffee and that would have been fine too.

Good coffee places find this balance. Frank finds it.

## the people

The baristas know coffee. Really know it — origins, roasting, extraction. If you're interested, they'll talk about it. If you're not, they'll just make you an excellent drink without the lecture.

There's a regulars' culture. The same faces every morning, greeting each other, having the same conversations. A coffee shop that's been here long enough becomes a community centre.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** Early morning for quiet and fresh pastries. Weekday mid-morning for space to work. First thing after arrival to wake yourself up for the Whitstable day ahead.

**Avoid:** Weekend mid-mornings can be busy. Not unpleasant, but if you want space, aim earlier or later.

**Working here:** Yes, you can. Bring headphones, be reasonable about how long you stay on one cup, and you'll be fine.

## what to order

- **Flat white** — The standard. Done exceptionally well.
- **Pour-over** — If you're interested in the single-origin offerings. More delicate, more interesting, takes longer.
- **Espresso** — If you want to taste the coffee without milk diluting it.
- **Batch brew** — For filter coffee fans. Usually very good.
- **Pastry** — The croissants and similar are sourced well. Not made in-house, but chosen carefully.

## the honest take

If you don't care about coffee — if a latte is a latte is a latte — Frank might feel like overkill. The prices are higher than generic cafés. The attention to detail is wasted if you just want caffeine and don't notice the difference.

The space is nice but not huge. When it's busy, it's busy. There's no garden, no sprawling terrace. It's a compact operation.

And it is, at the end of the day, a coffee shop in a small town. It's not reinventing the form. It's just doing it right — which is exactly what Whitstable needed.

For people who care about coffee, Frank is essential. For everyone else, it's a very nice café that makes reliably excellent drinks. Either way, worth a visit.
