# The Sportsman: a Michelin star in a pub on the marshes

The Sportsman looks like a mistake. You drive out of Whitstable along the coast road, past the caravan parks and the marshes, and there's this slightly scruffy pub on the edge of nowhere. No sign announcing its Michelin star. No valet parking. Just a building that looks like it's been here forever, because it has.

Then you eat there, and you understand why people book three months in advance.

## the origin story

Stephen Harris took over The Sportsman in 1999 when it was a failing local boozer with sticky carpets and a dart board. He'd been a maths teacher. He taught himself to cook. This is not the typical fine dining origin story.

What Harris figured out was that he didn't want to import fancy ingredients — he wanted to use what was right outside the door. The marshes, the sea, the farms within a few miles. He started curing his own meats, churning his own butter, smoking his own fish. He made his own salt by evaporating sea water from the creek out back.

The first Michelin star came in 2008. They haven't lost it since. And yet: there's no tasting menu, no white tablecloths, no sommelier in a waistcoat. It's still a pub. You can still have a pint at the bar if you want.

## what locals know

Booking is essential. Three months ahead for weekends, maybe less for midweek. They release tables on the first of each month, so set a reminder if you're serious.

The set lunch menu is significantly cheaper than dinner and just as good. If you're watching the budget, this is the move.

Some locals go just for a drink and a bar snack — the pork scratchings are made in-house, the bread basket is legendary. You can have a Sportsman experience without spending Sportsman dinner prices.

The drive along the coast road is part of it. Time your arrival for late afternoon, have dinner, drive back through the marshes at sunset. That's the full experience.

## the signature experience

The slip sole is the dish people talk about. It's a whole sole, cooked in a brown butter that's been enriched with the salt they make out back, served simply with greens. The butter pools on the plate. It's not complicated. It's perfect.

The other signature is the bread. Not because fancy restaurants always have good bread, but because here it means something. They make it. They churn the butter that goes on it. They gather the salt. By the time you've eaten a few slices with proper butter, you've already had something better than most restaurants' main courses.

The menu changes constantly based on what's available. Oysters from the harbour. Lamb from farms you could drive to in ten minutes. Herbs from the garden. The fixed tasting menus let the kitchen decide, and honestly, you should let them decide. They know what's good today better than you do.

## a moment that captures the place

I was there for lunch on a grey Tuesday in November. The dining room was half-full, mostly couples, a few foodies making notes. Through the window, the marshes stretched flat to the horizon under a slate sky.

The waiter brought the bread basket and explained the butter — how they churn it, what makes it different. He wasn't performing, just sharing something he found interesting. At the table next to me, a couple who'd driven from Manchester were asking about the salt, and the waiter brought out a little dish of it, still damp from the evaporation.

After dessert, I walked out to the creek where they collect the seawater. It was just... there. No signs, no visitor centre. Just the marsh, the water, and the knowledge that in a few weeks, some of it would end up seasoning someone's sole.

That's The Sportsman. It takes the snobbery out of fine dining without taking out the care.

## the people

Stephen Harris is still there, often in the kitchen, sometimes wandering the dining room. He's not performatively chummy, not trying to be a celebrity chef. He's a cook who happens to have a Michelin star, and he seems slightly bemused by the whole thing.

The front-of-house team are friendly, knowledgeable, and relaxed. They'll explain dishes if you ask, recommend wines, and otherwise leave you alone. There's no stuffiness. People are in jeans. It's fine.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** Midweek lunch is the sweet spot — easier to book, cheaper, same kitchen. Winter visits have a particular magic when the marshes are moody and grey.

**Avoid:** Summer Saturdays are booked months out and the car park is chaos. If you're booking that far ahead, go for Sunday lunch instead — slightly more relaxed.

**Book:** Seriously, book. They answer the phone, they're nice about it, but you do need a reservation for the dining room. The bar is first-come for snacks and drinks only.

## what to order

- **The bread and butter** — Accept the basket. Eat all of it. This is not filler.
- **Slip sole** — The signature. Worth the visit alone.
- **The tasting menu** — If it's a special occasion, let them decide. You won't regret it.
- **Bar snacks** — The pork scratchings, the oysters. Available without a dining room reservation.
- **Whatever's on today** — The menu changes. Ask what's good. The answer is all of it, but some things are particularly good.

## the honest take

It's expensive. Not offensively so for this level of cooking — lunch can be done for £50-60 a head — but dinner with wine is a proper investment. Some people will find it precious, will think the attention to local sourcing is performative. It's not, but if you're not into that stuff, you're paying for something you won't notice.

The location is remote. The drive is pretty but it's not "pop in for dinner" accessible. You're making a trip of it.

And the pub setting, while charming, isn't everyone's vision of a Michelin-starred meal. There's no theatre, no drama, no tableside fireworks. If you want that, go somewhere else. This is serious cooking in an intentionally unselfconscious setting.

For me, it's the best restaurant in Kent and one of the best in the country. But it's best appreciated by people who understand what they're eating — where it came from, why it matters, how much thought went into that "simple" slip sole.
