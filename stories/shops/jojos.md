# JoJo's: the meze place everyone argues about

JoJo's is the most divisive restaurant in Whitstable. Half the town thinks it's the best meal you can have here. The other half thinks it's good but not worth the wait. Both halves are having this argument in the queue outside.

The food is Mediterranean-Turkish meze. The restaurant is tiny. The booking policy is complicated. The reputation is enormous.

## the origin story

JoJo's has been on Tankerton seafront for over twenty years, run by the same family, serving the same style of food. Before Whitstable became fashionable, it was already here — a small neighbourhood restaurant doing meze and grilled fish with sea views.

As the town grew trendy, JoJo's got discovered. The queues grew. The wait times became legendary. What was once a local secret became a destination, which meant it stopped being a secret but kept being good.

The restaurant hasn't changed much. It's still small, still family-run, still serving the same generous meze platters. The only difference is that getting a table now requires planning, luck, or patience.

## what locals know

The booking system: they take reservations for early evening (around 6pm). For later slots, you queue. The queue can be two hours on summer weekends. This is not an exaggeration.

Go in winter. Go on a Tuesday. Go at 6pm if you can book. The meze is identical whenever you go; the experience is dramatically different.

The terrace is the premium spot — sea views, outdoor atmosphere. If you get offered inside, it's still good, but the terrace is the dream.

The portions are generous. Order less than you think you need. The meze platter for two is a lot of food.

## the signature experience

The meze platter. A table covered with small plates: hummus, tzatziki, falafel, halloumi, stuffed vine leaves, grilled vegetables, warm bread. Everything comes at once, shared between everyone at the table. It's the opposite of the carefully paced restaurant experience — everything is there, dig in.

The setting matters. The terrace overlooking the sea. The evening light. The informal atmosphere. JoJo's works as a full experience in a way that takeaway never quite captures.

## a moment that captures the place

A summer evening, 8:30pm. The queue was an hour long. My friend and I nearly gave up twice. We stayed because we'd come this far and didn't have a backup plan.

When we finally got a table on the terrace, the sun was setting over Tankerton. The meze arrived — plate after plate covering the small table. We ate until we couldn't move, watched the light fade over the water, and admitted that yes, it was worth the wait.

The next morning, sober and rational, I wasn't sure it was worth a two-hour queue. But in the moment, with the view and the food and the whole experience? Yes. It was.

## the people

Family-run means what it says. The same people have been running this for years, and it shows. There's a rhythm to the service — efficient because it has to be, friendly because that's how they are.

The kitchen handles huge volumes without compromising quality. This is harder than it looks. Somehow the hummus is still good when they're feeding a hundred people a night.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** October through April. Weekday evenings. The 6pm booking slot if you can get it.

**Avoid:** Saturday night in July. You'll queue for two hours, the place will be chaotic, and you'll wonder what you did to deserve this.

**Terrace tactics:** If you book early, you can sometimes request terrace. If you queue, you take what you get. Specify if you really care.

## what to order

- **The meze platter** — This is the move. Hot and cold meze, more food than you expect.
- **Fish** — The grilled fish options are reliable.
- **Halloumi** — Specifically good here. Ask for extra.
- **Falafel** — Better than most.
- **Wine** — The Turkish options are worth exploring. Something you might not drink elsewhere.

Order less than you think you need. Seriously.

## the honest take

The queue is real and sometimes absurd. If you're not willing to wait, you need to plan carefully around booking windows or off-peak times.

The food is good, but it's meze — there's a ceiling on how good meze can be. Some people leave thinking it was great but not life-changing. They're not wrong.

The popularity creates pressure. The restaurant runs hot, the turnover is fast, you're not lingering over coffee. If you want a leisurely three-hour dinner, this isn't it.

And the debate will never end. Is JoJo's worth the hype? Some say absolutely. Some say it's overrated. The food hasn't changed — it's still what it's always been. What's changed is expectations.

For me: it's a lovely restaurant with good food and a great setting. On a quiet Tuesday with no queue, it's unambiguously wonderful. On a crowded Saturday with a two-hour wait, the calculation is harder. Know what you're signing up for.
