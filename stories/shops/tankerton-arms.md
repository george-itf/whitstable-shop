# Tankerton Arms: Slopes views

The Tankerton Arms sits at the top of the Slopes, looking down over Tankerton beach and out to sea. It's a pub with a view that does a lot of work — and fortunately, the pub itself holds up its end.

## the origin story

The Tankerton Arms has been here for as long as anyone remembers, serving the residential end of Whitstable. It's less touristy than the harbour pubs, more neighbourhood-local in character.

The pub went through a refurbishment in recent years, balancing the upgrade with keeping what made it a proper pub. The kitchen improved, the beer selection expanded, but it stayed a place where locals felt at home.

The location — top of the Slopes, looking over the parade of Tankerton — means the view has always been the selling point. On a clear day, you can see across the water to the wind farm and beyond.

## what locals know

The garden is the draw. The view down the Slopes to the sea, afternoon sun, pint in hand. This is Whitstable's best beer garden view.

Sunday lunch is reliable. Roasts done properly, the kind of Sunday pub lunch that keeps you coming back.

It's quieter than the harbour pubs. The tourists who pour off the train and walk down to the seafront often don't make it up to Tankerton. The regulars appreciate this.

The food is better than it needs to be. They could coast on the location; they don't.

## the signature experience

A pint in the garden on a summer evening. The sun is setting over the Slopes, the light going golden, the sea doing that thing where it turns silver and pink. Someone's dog is asleep under a table. There's nowhere to be, nothing to do.

This is Tankerton's pace. Slower than the harbour, residential, relaxed.

## a moment that captures the place

A Sunday afternoon in October. The garden was still busy — locals knew this was the last good weather before winter set in. Dogs, families, couples, groups of friends.

At the table next to me, three generations of a family were doing Sunday lunch. The grandmother was telling stories about Whitstable when she was young. The grandkids were mostly interested in their chips but occasionally listened.

Inside, the Sunday roasts kept coming out of the kitchen. Outside, the Slopes were green and gold. Everyone seemed to know everyone else.

"New here?" the man at the next table asked.

"Visiting," I said.

"Well, you found the right pub."

## the people

The staff are local-pub friendly. They know the regulars, they welcome newcomers, they keep things running without fuss. It's the kind of pub where the bartender remembers what you were drinking last time.

The crowd is neighbourhood — people who live in Tankerton, families, dog owners. Less London-at-the-weekend than the harbour pubs, more actual local.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** Summer evenings for the garden. Sunday lunch for roasts. Any time you want to escape the harbour crowds.

**Avoid:** If the weather's bad, the garden loses its appeal and the inside is just a normal pub. Choose your day.

**Book for Sunday lunch:** In summer especially. The roasts are popular and tables fill.

## what to order

- **Pint** — They pour a good one. Shepherd Neame and guests.
- **Sunday roast** — Why you'd come on Sunday.
- **Pub food** — Better than average. Fish and chips, pies, the classics.
- **Something from the garden menu** — Lighter options for outdoor drinking.

## the honest take

The view carries a lot. Without the garden, this is a nice neighbourhood pub. With the garden, on the right evening, it's special.

It's a trek from the harbour. Not far, but uphill, and you need to want to go there. This is good for locals — it keeps the crowds away — but means casual visitors often don't bother.

The food is good but not exceptional. You're not coming here for a destination meal; you're coming for pub food with a view.

And it is a local pub, which means the vibe is regulars-and-newcomers rather than tourist-central. Some visitors find this less welcoming. It's not unfriendly, just... local. You're joining their pub, not being catered to as a visitor.

For what it is — a good pub with a great view in the quieter part of town — it's exactly right. The Tankerton Arms knows what it is and does it well.
