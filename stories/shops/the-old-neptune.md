# The Old Neptune: the pub that sits on the beach

The Neptune — everyone calls it the Neppy — is a pub built directly on the shingle beach. Not near the beach. On it. The building sits on the stones, waves hit the wall during storms, and yes, it floods sometimes. This sounds impractical because it is impractical. That's not the point.

The point is sitting with a pint watching the tide come in, knowing you're in one of the most unlikely buildings in England.

## the origin story

There's been a pub here since at least the 1840s, rebuilt several times after various storms and floods destroyed it. The current building dates from 1897, though it's been patched and repaired so many times that "dates from" is doing a lot of work.

The Neptune has flooded multiple times in living memory — 1953, 1978, 2013. Each time they clear out, dry up, and reopen. There are photos behind the bar of staff wading through knee-deep water. The pub exists in spite of the sea, not because of it.

For years it was a proper local boozer. Then Whitstable became fashionable and the Neppy became famous. It's still a pub, but it's also an Instagram location, a tourist destination, and one of the most photographed buildings in Kent. The staff have adjusted.

## what locals know

Go in winter. Go on a weekday. Go at 11am when it opens or at 5pm on a Tuesday when everyone's at home. The summer weekend version of the Neppy is loud, crowded, and stressful. The February Tuesday version is perfect.

The back room is quieter than the front. The front has the view but also the crowds. Pick your trade-off.

The fireplace is real and lit in winter. If it's cold outside, get there early enough to claim a seat near it. Reading the paper by the fire while watching a grey sea — that's the Neppy at its best.

Pub food is pub food. Don't come expecting gastro miracles. Come for the pint and the view.

## the signature experience

A pint of Whitstable Bay, the local Shepherd Neame beer, at a table by the window, watching the tide. That's it. That's the experience.

In summer, you take your drink outside and sit on the stones. Kids run around. Dogs chase balls into the water. Sunsets happen. It's lovely but chaotic.

In winter, you stay inside and watch the storms. The waves hit the wall, the windows get sprayed, and there's something deeply satisfying about being warm and dry with a pint while the weather rages outside.

## a moment that captures the place

November, mid-afternoon, grey and wild. The pub was nearly empty — a couple of older locals at the bar, a man reading a book by the fire, me with a pint and nowhere to be.

The wind was up and occasionally a wave would hit the wall hard enough that you could feel it through the building. The barman didn't even look up anymore. This was normal.

A couple came in, tourists clearly, and immediately asked if it was safe. The barman explained that the pub had survived a hundred years of this, poured their pints, and pointed out where the flood photos were.

The couple stayed for three hours. By the time they left, they were on first-name terms with the regulars and planning to come back in December. That's what happens at the Neppy.

## the people

The staff are seasoned. They deal with enormous summer crowds, tourist questions, and locals who've been drinking here for decades. They're efficient and friendly in a brisk, no-nonsense way.

The regulars are still here, despite the tourists. You'll spot them at the bar, talking to the staff, not paying much attention to the view they've seen a thousand times. In winter, the ratio tips back toward locals.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** Winter. Weekday mornings. Early evenings before the post-work rush. Any time it's raining — fewer people, more atmosphere.

**Avoid:** Summer Saturday afternoons. The queue for the bar is fifteen deep and there's nowhere to sit. If you must go in summer, aim for a weekday or early evening.

**Check the tides:** High tide brings the view — waves up against the building. Low tide reveals the shingle stretch. Both are good, but they're different experiences.

## what to order

- **Whitstable Bay** — The local pale ale. It's fine. Not life-changing, but appropriate.
- **Guinness** — If you're a Guinness person, they pour a good one.
- **Whatever's on cask** — There are usually a couple of guest ales.
- **Fish and chips** — The pub food is decent. Don't expect gastro, do expect competent.
- **Coffee** — Acceptable if you're not drinking.

This is a pub. The beer is the point. Don't overthink it.

## the honest take

The Neppy is famous, and famous places attract crowds. On a summer weekend, the queue for the bar stretches out the door and the toilets are inadequate. This is not a peaceful experience.

The food is fine. It's pub food, sometimes on the wrong side of average. If you're hungry, it'll do. If you want a great meal, eat elsewhere and come here for a drink after.

The building is old and scruffy. The toilets are across a courtyard. The tables are crammed together. None of this is posh, and if you want posh, you've come to the wrong place.

And yet: sitting in the Neppy in winter, fire going, wind howling, pint in hand, looking out at the sea — there's nothing else like it. The building shouldn't exist, but it does, and that's somehow the whole point of Whitstable.
