# David Brown Delicatessen: proper deli

There's a certain type of deli — proper deli — that functions as more than a food shop. It's where you go for advice. It's where you stand at the counter having opinions about olive oil. It's where someone will talk you through which ham works with which mustard.

David Brown is that kind of deli.

## the origin story

David Brown has been on Harbour Street for over two decades, outlasting various waves of Whitstable's evolution from quiet seaside town to foodie destination. The shop has grown and adapted but kept its core identity: a proper deli selling proper ingredients.

The principle is curation over quantity. You won't find twenty types of pesto. You'll find two, and they'll both be good. Someone has tasted everything, rejected what wasn't good enough, and stocked what made the cut.

This is the deli model at its best. Not overwhelming choice, but reliable quality and someone behind the counter who can explain what you're buying.

## what locals know

The sandwiches are excellent and not expensive. Made on good bread with deli-quality ingredients. The lunchtime queue reflects this.

The cheese selection overlaps with The Cheese Box down the road, but there are different options here. Worth visiting both.

They'll make up platters and boards for parties. Give them notice and a budget, and they'll do the work.

The Italian stuff — olive oils, vinegars, pasta — is particularly well-chosen. If you're restocking your cupboard, start here.

## the signature experience

Walking in to buy one thing and walking out with three. The sandwich for lunch, obviously. But then you spot the olives and remember you're out of olives. And the bread looks good. And that olive oil you've been meaning to try. And a wedge of that pecorino.

Proper delis have this effect. Everything looks good, everything is good, and your basket fills itself.

## a moment that captures the place

A man was trying to describe a ham he'd had on holiday in Spain. "It was dark, really intense, kind of sweet..." He had no name, just sense memories.

"Ibérico," said the woman behind the counter. "Probably aged about 24 months. We've got something similar — not quite as rare, but the same idea." She sliced a sample, handed it over.

"That's it," the man said. "That's exactly it."

He left with an embarrassingly expensive amount of ham and a grin on his face. That's what good deli counter service looks like.

## the people

The staff know food. Not just "this is where things are" but actually knowing what things taste like, where they're from, what to do with them. You can ask questions and get useful answers.

This sounds basic, but it's increasingly rare. The supermarket staff don't know. The chain food shops don't know. The people at David Brown know.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** Late morning for browsing. Lunchtime if you want a sandwich (but expect a queue). Weekdays for personal attention.

**Avoid:** Peak summer weekends when Harbour Street is chaos. You can't appreciate a deli when you're being jostled.

**Party planning:** Call ahead. Let them know what you're doing and they'll prepare what you need.

## what to buy

- **Sandwich** — For lunch. Made fresh, deli quality.
- **Olive oil** — They stock the good stuff. Ask what's particularly good right now.
- **Cheese** — A proper selection. Different from but complementary to The Cheese Box.
- **Cured meats** — Sliced to order. Prosciutto, bresaola, the good salamis.
- **Antipasti** — Olives, artichokes, sundried tomatoes. The jar stuff and the counter stuff.
- **Pasta** — Dried, fresh sometimes. Proper brands.

## the honest take

It's a deli, not a restaurant. If you want to sit down and eat, there's limited space. This is grab-and-go or stock-up-and-leave.

The prices are fair for quality but not supermarket prices. That olive oil costs what good olive oil costs. If you're comparing to Tesco, you'll baulk. If you're comparing to quality, it's reasonable.

Harbour Street location means summer crowds affect the experience. A calm Tuesday browse is different from fighting through tourists on a August Saturday.

And it's not trying to be everything. The range is curated, which means some things you want might not be there. But what's there is good. That's the trade-off.

For people who cook and care about ingredients, David Brown is essential. For people who don't cook much, it's a nice sandwich shop. Both are valid ways to experience it.
