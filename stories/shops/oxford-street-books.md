# Oxford Street Books: the bookshop with the cat

Oxford Street Books is the kind of bookshop that feels like a personal recommendation from someone with excellent taste. It's small, carefully curated, and presided over by a cat who may or may not acknowledge your presence depending on their mood.

The shop sits on Oxford Street — not the main tourist drag, but the quieter street where locals actually buy things. This is deliberate. The whole operation is deliberate.

## the origin story

Independent bookshops are endangered species. The story is always the same: Amazon, supermarkets, changing habits. Oxford Street Books exists because someone decided to run a bookshop anyway, choosing quality over quantity, curation over comprehensiveness.

The shop doesn't try to stock everything. It stocks what the owner thinks is worth reading. Walk in looking for the latest bestseller and you might not find it. Walk in open to suggestions and you'll leave with something better.

This model only works in places where people value it. Whitstable, full of creative types, weekenders, and people who still read actual books, is exactly the right place.

## what locals know

The cat is real and present most days. Their name is available upon polite enquiry. They enjoy being admired but are selective about being touched. Respect the cat's boundaries.

The staff give excellent recommendations. Tell them what you last read and liked, and they'll find your next book. This is the whole point of indie bookshops.

They host events — readings, signings, book groups. Check the window or ask about what's coming up.

The children's section is surprisingly good for a small shop. Chosen with care, not just whatever's popular.

## the signature experience

Wandering in without an agenda. Browsing the staff picks. Noticing a cover that catches your eye. Asking if it's any good. Getting a three-sentence description that tells you exactly whether it's for you or not.

Leaving with a book you'd never have found on Amazon because you didn't know to search for it.

That's the value of curation. Someone has done the filtering for you. Someone who reads for a living and knows what they're talking about.

## a moment that captures the place

I was buying a present for a friend — late thirties, likes literary fiction but nothing too depressing, already has all the obvious stuff. I explained this to the woman behind the counter.

"Right," she said. "Has she read The Overstory? What about Piranesi? Does she like American or British more? Contemporary or is historical okay?"

Two minutes of questions and she'd narrowed it to three options. She explained each one. I picked the middle one. My friend loved it.

I couldn't have done that on a website. The algorithm doesn't ask questions. The algorithm doesn't see your face when you explain what your friend likes.

## the people

The staff are readers. Not retail workers who happen to sell books — actual people who read constantly and have opinions about what they've read. This matters. A recommendation from someone who's read the book is worth a hundred "customers also bought" suggestions.

The owner is around, hands-on, clearly running this as a passion project as much as a business. You can tell because the stock reflects actual taste rather than publishing trends.

And the cat. The cat is essential staff.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** Weekday afternoons are quiet and you can chat to staff properly. Saturday morning has a nice browse-and-coffee vibe if you're not in a rush.

**Avoid:** Nothing really to avoid — it's never heaving. But if you want proper staff attention, don't come when a coach tour has descended on Harbour Street.

**Rainy days:** Perfect. This is exactly the rainy day activity. Browse, chat, buy, retreat to a café with your new book.

## what to buy

- **Whatever they recommend** — Seriously. Tell them what you like and trust them.
- **The staff picks** — There's always a shelf or table of these. Start there.
- **Children's books** — Curated, not just the usual suspects.
- **Local interest** — Books about Whitstable, Kent, the coast. Good for visitors.
- **Cards and gifts** — The bookshop extras are chosen with the same care as the books.

## the honest take

The selection is small. If you want a specific book, check they have it before making the trip. They can order things in, but it defeats the point of the browse.

It's not the cheapest. Indie bookshops can't compete with Amazon on price. You're paying a few pounds more for the experience, the advice, and the knowledge that you're keeping a good shop alive. Most people think that's worth it.

The cat might ignore you. The cat ignores most people. Don't take it personally.

Oxford Street itself is quieter than Harbour Street — fewer restaurants, more everyday shops. This is part of the charm. You're shopping where locals shop, not where tourists queue.
