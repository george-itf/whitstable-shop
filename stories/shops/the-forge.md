# The Forge: craft and coffee

The Forge is part café, part craft workshop, part creative community hub. It's harder to categorise than other places, which is part of the appeal. You might come for coffee and leave having signed up for a printmaking course.

The building is a converted forge — hence the name — and keeps some of that industrial character. High ceilings, exposed beams, the sense that things get made here.

## the origin story

The Forge emerged from Whitstable's creative community — the artists, makers, and craft people who've been part of the town's identity long before it became a foodie destination. The space combines a café with a working print studio and workshop space.

The principle is that creativity and coffee go together. Come for one, discover the other. The café subsidises the studios; the studios give the café character. It's a model that works in a town with enough creative residents to sustain it.

## what locals know

The courses are the hidden value. Printmaking, bookbinding, letterpress — actual skills taught by actual craftspeople. Check the website for what's coming up.

The café is good but not trying to compete with Frank on pure coffee obsession. It's good enough, in a more interesting space.

The garden out back is a nice spot when weather allows. Less discovered than the front room.

Events happen — exhibitions, open studios, maker markets. Worth checking what's on.

## the signature experience

Coffee in the main space, surrounded by letterpress equipment and prints on the walls. The smell of ink and coffee mingling. Someone at the next table sketching in a notebook. The sense of being in a place where things happen rather than just a place that sells things.

Or: an afternoon printmaking workshop, learning something new, leaving with something you made yourself.

## a moment that captures the place

A Saturday afternoon, quiet between lunch and dinner crowds. A woman was at the press, pulling a print. She'd done a one-day course and come back to use the open access time. The café staff had made her coffee and were watching with interest.

She held up the print — slightly imperfect, clearly handmade, uniquely hers. "I haven't made anything with my hands in years," she said. "I forgot what it felt like."

That's what The Forge is for. Reminding people that making things is satisfying, and providing the space and skills to do it.

## the people

The team includes working artists and printmakers, not just café staff. They're invested in the creative side, not just the coffee side. Ask about the studios and you'll get real answers from people who use them.

The regulars include a lot of Whitstable's creative community. If you're interested in that world, this is where you'll find it.

## the honest take

This isn't primarily a café. If you just want excellent coffee, Frank is better. If you want a full brunch menu, go elsewhere. The Forge is about the combination — creativity, coffee, community.

The space can feel quiet if nothing's happening. The energy comes from activities, classes, events. Check what's on before visiting if you want the full experience.

Some visitors don't get it. They want a café and find a workshop. Or they want a workshop and find a café. The hybrid model is the point, but it confuses people expecting pure versions of either.

For the right visitor — someone interested in making things, in creative communities, in spaces that aren't just about consumption — The Forge is special. It represents something about Whitstable that isn't just oysters and beaches.
