# The Cheese Box: more than just cheese

The Cheese Box is, yes, a cheese shop. But it's the kind of cheese shop that becomes the centre of your weekly routine — the place you pop into for lunch, the place that knows what you like, the place that somehow always has the exact thing you didn't know you needed.

It's also legitimately one of the best cheese shops in Kent, which helps.

## the origin story

Lou and her team have been running The Cheese Box on Harbour Street since 2005, carving out a loyal following in a town full of good food shops. What started as a small cheese counter has expanded into something more comprehensive — cheese, charcuterie, wine, sandwiches, salads, and all the bits that make a proper picnic or a good night in.

The shop is small. There's a counter running down one side with the cheese, a display of deli items, and a few seats for people grabbing lunch. It's not trying to be a restaurant. It's trying to be the best version of what it is — a proper local deli with exceptional cheese at its heart.

## what locals know

The lunch sandwiches are excellent and not expensive. Made to order on good bread with cheese that would cost twice as much in London. The queue at lunch can be long in summer, but it moves fast.

They do cheese boards for takeaway — perfect for a beach picnic. Tell them what you like and what you're drinking, and they'll put something together.

The cheese selection is curated, not overwhelming. You won't find a hundred cheeses here. You'll find thirty or forty, all chosen because they're good. Trust their recommendations.

Christmas hampers are a thing. Order early because they sell out.

## the signature experience

Walking in without a plan and walking out with everything you need for dinner. A wedge of Comte, some good charcuterie, olives, crackers, a bottle of wine they recommended. The kind of shopping that makes you feel briefly French.

Or: a sandwich at one of the tiny tables, watching Harbour Street go by, thinking about nothing in particular.

## a moment that captures the place

A Saturday morning in October. The shop was busy — not rammed, but that nice level of buzz. A family was putting together a picnic board for the beach. A man was having a serious conversation about cheddar maturation. A woman was explaining to the staff that she was cooking for someone who "only thinks they don't like blue cheese."

The staff handled all of this simultaneously, without rushing anyone, without making it feel like a production line. Ten minutes later, the picnic family left with a perfect board, the cheddar man had learned something new, and the blue cheese sceptic had walked out with a wedge of Cashel Blue "just to try."

Everyone got exactly what they needed, even if they didn't know what that was when they walked in.

## the people

Lou runs the show with a team who genuinely know cheese. Not in a show-off way — in a "let me find you exactly the right thing" way. They ask questions. What are you eating it with? What do you normally like? Is it for tonight or later this week?

This matters. Bad cheese shops just sell you whatever. Good cheese shops match you with cheese. The Cheese Box is a good cheese shop.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** Weekday mornings for a calm browse. Saturday morning for the buzz. Lunchtime if you want a sandwich, but accept the queue.

**Avoid:** Midsummer weekend lunchtimes — the queue goes out the door and Harbour Street is chaos anyway.

**Plan ahead:** If you want a cheese board for a party or event, give them a day's notice and they'll make it perfect.

---

## what to order

- **Lunch sandwich** — Changes daily. Pick the one with the most interesting cheese.
- **Cheese board for two** — Tell them your budget and trust them.
- **Something British** — They have excellent local and British cheeses. Ask what's particularly good right now.
- **Something stinky** — If you're into that. They'll have something that'll challenge your flatmates.
- **Wine** — The selection is small but good. Let them match it to what you're buying.

## the honest take

It's a small shop. If you're uncomfortable with close quarters or queuing, it might not be for you.

The prices are fair for the quality, but this is proper cheese, not supermarket cheddar. Budget accordingly.

It's not the place for a long browsing session on a busy day. Know roughly what you want, or accept that you're going to trust their recommendations. Both are fine.

And it's not just about cheese anymore — the deli section, the lunches, the picnic stuff — they do all of it well. But the cheese is still the heart. If you don't care about cheese, you're missing the point.
