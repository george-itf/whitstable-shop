# Fishslab Gallery: art on the harbour

The Fishslab Gallery sits in a converted fishmonger's building on the harbour, which explains the name and the faint lingering sense that this space has a history. The fish are gone; the art has moved in.

It's a small space showing work by contemporary artists, many of them local or connected to Whitstable. The exhibitions change regularly, and the quality is consistently higher than "local gallery" usually implies.

## the origin story

The building was, genuinely, a fish slab — one of the working fish retail spots on the harbour. As the fishing industry declined and Whitstable's arts scene grew, the space transformed.

The gallery has been running for years now, establishing itself as a serious venue rather than a tourist gift shop. The artists shown here have careers beyond Whitstable; the work is priced for collectors as well as visitors.

This matters because it means the gallery contributes to Whitstable's cultural life rather than just trading on it. The town attracts artists, the gallery shows artists, the cycle continues.

## what locals know

Exhibitions change every few weeks. Worth checking what's on before visiting — you might love one show and feel nothing about another. That's galleries.

The opening nights are small events, sometimes with the artists present. Good way to experience the gallery at its liveliest.

It's free. Just walk in, look around, walk out. No pressure to buy, no entrance fee, no obligation.

The harbour location means you combine it with a walk along the harbour arm or oysters at one of the shacks. Art and seafood: a Whitstable afternoon.

## the signature experience

Ducking in from the harbour on a grey day. The space is quiet, the light is good, and someone has hung work that makes you think. Five minutes becomes twenty. You leave having seen something unexpected.

That's the value of a good small gallery. It interrupts your day with something you weren't looking for.

## a moment that captures the place

A show by a ceramicist who'd been working in Whitstable for decades. The pieces were displayed on simple plinths, the light catching the glazes. The artist was there, chatting with visitors, explaining techniques.

A woman asked about a particular piece. The artist described making it — the firing, the uncertainty, the moment of opening the kiln. The piece cost more than the woman had planned to spend. She bought it anyway.

"I wasn't going to," she said later, "but hearing him talk about it... I couldn't not."

That's what galleries can do. Create connections between makers and buyers that can't happen online.

## the people

The gallery is run by people who care about art, not just about sales. They'll talk to you about the current show, the artist, the ideas. They won't pressure you to buy.

The artists shown are a mix — established names, emerging talents, locals and others. The curation has a point of view, which means you can trust that what's on will be interesting even if it's not to your taste.

## when to go, when to avoid

**Go:** When there's a show you're interested in. Opening nights for atmosphere. Any calm day for a quiet browse.

**Avoid:** Nothing to avoid, really. If the current show doesn't interest you, wait for the next one.

**Check listings:** The website and social media show what's on. Worth checking before making a special trip.

---

## what to expect

- **Current exhibition** — Whatever's on. Could be painting, photography, ceramics, mixed media.
- **A small space** — This is a boutique gallery, not a museum. Ten minutes might be enough; an hour is possible if you're engaged.
- **Art for sale** — Prices vary from accessible to collector-level. No pressure either way.
- **Information** — Ask the staff about the work. They know their stuff.

## the honest take

It's a small gallery. If the current show doesn't resonate, there's not much else to do but leave. That's fine — not every show is for every person.

The art is priced as art, which means some pieces cost real money. This isn't a gift shop. If you're looking for a £20 souvenir, go elsewhere.

Location is part of the appeal but can be a limitation. The harbour is lovely, but it's a specific trip if you're coming just for the gallery. Best combined with other harbour activities.

For visitors who care about art, Fishslab is a genuine draw. For visitors who don't, it's a quick look and a nice building. Both experiences are valid.
