# best coffee

With specific orders at each place.

---

## 1. Frank

**What to order:** Flat white, or pour-over if you want to explore single origins.

**Why it's best:** Frank takes coffee seriously in a way other places don't. The beans are sourced carefully. The extraction is done properly. The baristas understand what they're doing. This is the only place in Whitstable where coffee is the primary focus rather than an accompaniment.

**The experience:** Early morning, quiet, good light. Order the flat white. It arrives properly textured, properly temperatured. Drink it slowly.

**For coffee geeks:** Ask about the single-origin options. Get a pour-over. Discuss the beans. This is your place.

## 2. The Forge

**What to order:** Whatever you're comfortable with — espresso drinks, filter coffee.

**Why it's second:** Good coffee in an interesting space. Not as obsessive as Frank, but better than average. The creative workshop atmosphere adds something.

**The experience:** Coffee surrounded by letterpress equipment and craft studios. The coffee is good; the context makes it better.

## 3. Whitstable Produce Store

**What to order:** Standard espresso drinks. Americano, latte.

**Why it's here:** Often overlooked, reliably solid. A café that does proper coffee without making a big deal of it.

**The experience:** Good coffee with good food. The sort of place locals return to regularly.

## 4. David Brown Delicatessen

**What to order:** Espresso or cappuccino alongside your sandwich.

**Why it's here:** Not a coffee shop, but the espresso is decent. This is coffee as accompaniment to deli shopping, not coffee as destination.

**The experience:** You're there for the cheese and charcuterie. The coffee is a bonus.

## 5. The Cheese Box

**What to order:** Whatever's on the machine. Keep it simple.

**Why it's here:** Similar to David Brown — coffee exists, it's acceptable, it's not the point. You're there for cheese.

## the generic cafés

Various cafés along Harbour Street and elsewhere serve coffee. It's fine. It's not distinguished. If you just need caffeine and the above options aren't convenient, any café will do. Just don't expect specialty coffee culture from places with dusty espresso machines.

## the honest summary

Whitstable has one great coffee shop (Frank) and several good ones. If coffee matters to you, go to Frank. If it's an accompaniment to food or shopping, various places will serve you acceptably.

The gap between Frank and everywhere else is noticeable. Frank would be a good coffee shop in London. The others are good for a town this size. Know what you're after and choose accordingly.
