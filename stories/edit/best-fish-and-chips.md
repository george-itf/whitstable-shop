# best fish and chips

The controversial one.

## the ranking

**1. VC Jones**

The straightforward answer. This is a proper chippy doing proper fish and chips. Fresh fish, good batter, chips that are actually chips. It's busy on Fridays because it's good.

**What to order:** Cod and chips. Or haddock if you prefer. The fish specials when available.

**Why it wins:** Consistency. This is a chippy that knows what it's doing and keeps doing it. No gimmicks, no reinvention. Just fish and chips.

---

**2. The Lobster Shack**

Not a chippy in the traditional sense, but the fish and chips option exists and is good. The advantage: you're eating on the beach. The fish is fresh. The atmosphere adds to the meal.

**What to order:** Fish and chips, obviously. Whatever fish is available.

**Why it's second:** It's more casual, more basic in presentation. The VC Jones experience is more "proper chippy." But the Lobster Shack delivers on beach eating.

**3. The harbour shacks**

Various places around the harbour serve fish and chips. Quality varies. Some are good; some are tourist traps coasting on location.

**Guidance:** If there's a queue, usually a good sign. If the fish looks like it's been sitting under lamps too long, move on.

## the controversy

Everyone has opinions about fish and chips. Here's where the debate lies:

**"VC Jones is overrated"** — Some people find it crowded, expensive for chips, not worth the queue. Counter-argument: the queue exists because it's good.

**"The harbour places are tourist traps"** — Some are, some aren't. The visible ones on the tourist path get more skepticism. Sometimes unfairly.

**"Just get fish from Wheeler's"** — Wheeler's fish pie is excellent. But it's not fish and chips. Different category.

**"Make it yourself"** — Buy fish from the market, take it home, fry it properly. The freshest option. But requires effort and a kitchen.

## what good fish and chips means

**The fish:**
- Fresh, not previously frozen (in Whitstable, this should be standard)
- Properly battered — crisp outside, flaky inside
- Not greasy — the oil was hot enough
- The right size — generous but not absurd

**The chips:**
- Actually potato, actually fried
- Crisp outside, fluffy inside
- Salted properly
- Hot when served

**The experience:**
- Quick enough — this is fast food
- Wrapped properly if taking away
- Served hot — no warming lamps tragedy

## the best way to eat them

**The traditional:** On the beach or harbour wall. Salt and vinegar. Watching the sea. Seagulls circling. This is the British seaside.

**The sit-down:** At the chippy, at a table. Proper plates. Less atmospheric but more comfortable.

**The hybrid:** Takeaway, find a spot, improvise seating. Maximum flexibility.

## the honest summary

VC Jones is the best traditional fish and chips in Whitstable. It's a chippy, it does chippy things, it does them well.

The Lobster Shack and harbour options provide alternatives with different atmospheres and slightly different experiences.

There's no hidden genius fish and chip place that only locals know about. VC Jones is the answer everyone gives because it's the correct answer. The queue on Friday proves it.
