# best pint

By vibe.

## best garden: The Tankerton Arms

The view down the Slopes to the sea. A summer evening. A cold pint. This is what beer gardens are for.

The garden is the whole point of the Tankerton Arms. Inside is fine; outside is why you came. Position yourself with the view, order something from the bar, and watch the light change over the water.

**The pint:** Whatever's on cask. Shepherd Neame options are reliable.

## best local: The Duke of Cumberland

The pub for locals, not tourists. Island Wall territory. The regulars know each other. The dog under that table belongs to the person at the bar. This is a neighborhood pub in the truest sense.

If you want to drink where Whitstable actually drinks (rather than where Whitstable tourists drink), the Duke is the answer. You won't be unwelcome, but you'll be joining their pub, not being entertained at yours.

**The pint:** Whatever the regulars are having. Ask the barman.

## best view: The Neptune

A pub on the beach. Actually on the beach. Waves hit the wall. The view is the sea, right there, no gardens or promenades in between.

The Neptune is famous for a reason. The location is absurd. The building shouldn't exist. But it does, and drinking here — especially with weather happening outside — is an essential Whitstable experience.

**The pint:** Whitstable Bay, the local pale ale. When in Rome.

## best fire: The Neptune (again)

In winter, the Neptune fires up properly. The same pub that's about outdoor drinking in summer becomes about indoor warming in winter. The contrast between the fire inside and the weather outside is the whole appeal.

Alternative: The Duke also does fires well. Smaller, cosier, less famous.

**The pint:** Something warming. A porter or stout if they have one.

## best after a walk: The Pearson's Arms

You've walked West Beach, or along the promenade, or wherever. You need a pint. The Pearson's Arms sits on the Sea Wall, serves proper beer, and has that earned-drink feeling.

The food is good too if the walk made you hungry. But sometimes you just want the pint.

**The pint:** Check the guest ales. They usually have something interesting.

## best for conversation: The Duke of Cumberland

When the Neptune is heaving and the tourist pubs are loud, the Duke is usually quiet enough to actually talk. This makes it the best pub for catching up with a friend or having a conversation that matters.

The downside: you have to know about it and make the effort to go there. It's not on the tourist path.

**The pint:** Whatever you're comfortable with. The atmosphere is the point.

## best for beer: Whitstable Brewery Tap Room

If you want to geek out about beer — what it is, where it's from, how it's made — the tap room at the brewery is the place. They make the stuff. They can tell you about it.

The location is out of the centre. You have to make a trip. But for beer enthusiasts, it's worth it.

**The pint:** A flight, actually. Try several. Find your favorite.

## the default answer

If someone asks "where should I get a pint in Whitstable?" and I know nothing else about them, the answer is the Neptune. It's famous for a reason. The location is unique. The experience is memorable.

If they push back — "too touristy" or "too crowded" — then the Duke for local authenticity, or the Tankerton Arms for the garden, or the Pearson's Arms for food too.

But the Neptune is the default. You should go at least once. Probably in winter, with weather, with a fire. That's when it's best.
