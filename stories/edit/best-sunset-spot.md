# best sunset spot

Month by month, tide dependent.

## the short answer

**The harbour arm** is the default answer for most of the year. Walk out to the lighthouse, watch the sun drop, walk back in the last light. It's reliable and beautiful.

But the optimal spot shifts with the seasons as the sunset position moves along the horizon.

## month by month

**January–February:**
The sun sets roughly southwest, early (around 4-5pm). The harbour arm works. The Slopes at Tankerton catch the light well. Winter sunsets are often spectacular — the cold air creates clarity.

**March–April:**
Sunset moves later and further west. The harbour arm remains excellent. West Beach starts to become optimal as the sun tracks that direction.

**May–June:**
Long evenings, late sunsets (after 9pm by late June). The harbour arm is still good but busy. West Beach offers space. The Slopes at Tankerton face the right direction.

**July–August:**
Peak sunset position — almost due west. West Beach is arguably optimal. The harbour arm is crowded but still works. The Slopes are good. Any west-facing beach position delivers.

**September–October:**
Sunset moves back south and earlier. The harbour arm becomes optimal again. The Slopes still work. Autumn light is often excellent — golden, warm, dramatic clouds.

**November–December:**
Early sunsets, southwest position. The harbour arm. Inside pubs looking out (the Neptune's window is positioned for this). The Pearson's Arms terrace if you can stand the cold.

## tide considerations

**High tide + sunset = magic at the harbour**
Water up against the walls, reflecting the sky, boats floating. This combination — when high tide falls within an hour of sunset — is the most photogenic moment Whitstable offers.

**Low tide sunset**
Different but still good. The Street visible from Tankerton. The exposed beach creating different reflections. The mudflats have their own drama.

**How to plan:**
1. Find sunset time for your date
2. Find tide times
3. Look for days when they align (high tide near sunset)
4. Be in position 30 minutes before

## the spots

**The Harbour Arm**
Walk out to the lighthouse. Position yourself looking west-southwest. The 180-degree view means you see the full sky regardless of exact sun position. The most reliable choice.

**West Beach**
Fewer people, direct west view. Good for later summer when the sun sets almost due west. More peaceful than the harbour.

**The Slopes at Tankerton**
Elevated position looking down to the water. Good for any season. The social experience — everyone out on the grass watching together — is part of the appeal in summer.

**The Neptune's windows**
If weather is bad but the sky is dramatic, watching from inside the Neptune is an option. Less romantic, more practical.

**The Pearson's Arms terrace**
Sunset with a drink. Sea view position. Works well in warmer months.

## the honest guidance

Most sunsets are good from most west-facing positions. Don't overthink it. The harbour arm is easy, reliable, and delivers.

For the perfect sunset experience:
1. Check the forecast (clear sky needed)
2. Time it right (30 minutes before sunset, arrive in position)
3. High tide if possible (especially at the harbour)
4. Stay afterward (the afterglow is often better than the sunset itself)

The walk back along the harbour arm in fading light, the sky still glowing, the water silver — that's the full experience.
