# the whitstable glossary

Local terms, place names, and things visitors might not know.

## places

**The Street**
A shingle spit that runs out from Tankerton beach into the sea. Visible and walkable at low tide, completely underwater at high tide. One of Whitstable's strangest and most memorable features. Check tide times before going.

**The Slopes**
The long grassy hill above Tankerton beach. The classic Whitstable view — green grass dropping down to shingle and sea. Where locals picnic, watch sunsets, and walk dogs.

**The Harbour Arm**
The stone pier extending from the harbour out to a lighthouse at the end. The essential Whitstable walk. About ten minutes each way, with views of the town on one side and open sea on the other.

**Squeeze Gut Alley**
A narrow passage off Harbour Street. Yes, that's the real name. Contains small shops and galleries. Quintessentially Whitstable.

**Tankerton**
The residential area east of the harbour. Home to the Slopes, more peaceful than the harbour area, where many locals actually live.

**Seasalter**
The next village west, home to The Sportsman. About a two-mile walk along the coast.

**Island Wall**
A street running behind the harbour, known for converted warehouses and the Duke of Cumberland pub. Where locals live rather than where tourists go.

**The Horsebridge Centre**
Community arts venue on Horsebridge Road. Hosts exhibitions, events, and activities.

**Marine Parade**
The parade of shops and cafés along the top of the Slopes at Tankerton. Includes JoJo's.

**West Beach**
The stretch of coast running west from the harbour toward Seasalter. Quieter than the main beach, popular with dog walkers.

## people and culture

**DFLs**
"Down From London." The term for London weekenders and newcomers who've moved to Whitstable. Used by longer-term locals, not always affectionately. The irony is that DFLs have transformed the town's economy.

**The Neppy**
Local nickname for The Old Neptune pub.

## oysters and seafood

**Native oysters**
The traditional Whitstable oyster, species Ostrea edulis. In season September to April (months with an R). Smaller, flatter, more intense than rocks. More expensive.

**Rock oysters**
Crassostrea gigas, the year-round option. Larger, milder, more affordable. What most people eat most of the time. Also good.

**Shucking**
Opening oysters. Done with a special knife. Harder than it looks.

**Mignonette**
Shallot vinegar, the traditional accompaniment to oysters. Pronounced min-yon-YET.

## events

**Oyster Festival**
The big annual event, typically late July. Multiple days of music, entertainment, and oyster-related activities. The town at maximum capacity. Either wonderful or overwhelming, depending on your tolerance for crowds.

**New Year's Day Swim**
An informal tradition. People gather at the beach and get in the freezing water to start the year. Not official, just happens.

## tides and weather

**High tide**
When the water is at its highest. Boats float, waves hit walls, the beach is narrower.

**Low tide**
When the water is at its lowest. The Street is visible, boats sit on the mud, the beach expands.

**Spring tides**
The most extreme tides — very high highs and very low lows. Happen around full and new moons.

**Neap tides**
Moderate tides, less extreme range. Between springs.

**Mudflats**
The areas of mud exposed at low tide, particularly around the harbour. Don't walk on them — you can get stuck.

## the food and drink
