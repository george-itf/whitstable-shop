## the calendar truth

**Best time to visit:** September–October and April–May. Shoulder seasons with reasonable weather, fewer crowds, and everything open.

**Worst time to visit:** Summer Saturday at peak capacity. Unless you thrive on crowds.

**Most atmospheric:** December–February if you embrace winter. The town empties; what remains is essential.

The calendar isn't just about what happens — it's about what doesn't happen. The quiet months have their own appeal. The peak months have their costs. Choose based on what experience you want.
