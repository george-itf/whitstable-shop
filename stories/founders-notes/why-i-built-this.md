# why I built this

I got frustrated.

That's the honest answer. I got frustrated trying to find useful information about Whitstable — information that wasn't either a generic tourist board summary or a five-year-old TripAdvisor review.

## the problem

Google tells you Whitstable is famous for oysters. It gives you a list of restaurants with ratings out of five stars. It shows you the same dozen photos everyone has seen.

TripAdvisor tells you what tourists thought last year. Some of those reviews are helpful. Many are people complaining about queues at Wheeler's, which — fair enough, but the queue is half the point.

Instagram tells you Whitstable is photogenic. It doesn't tell you when to go, where to avoid, or what's actually worth your time.

None of these tell you what someone who actually knows the town would tell you over a cup of coffee. None of them have opinions. None of them say "skip this, try that, come on Tuesday not Saturday."

## what I wanted

I wanted a local guide that was actually local. Not written by someone who visited once and assembled a "things to do in Whitstable" listicle. Written by someone who knows the rhythm of the town, who has preferences, who can tell you which café is good and which is just surviving on passing trade.

I wanted honest information. Not everything is great. Some things are overrated. Some things close unexpectedly. Some things require planning that nobody mentions. A useful guide acknowledges this.

I wanted something that felt like a recommendation from a friend. "You should go to..." rather than "Visitors may enjoy..." The difference is voice, and voice is trust.

## what I'm trying to create

whitstable.shop is my attempt to be that friend.

Every piece of content here is written with one question in mind: "If my friend was visiting Whitstable for the first time, what would I actually tell them?"

Not the polished marketing version. Not the everything-is-amazing version. The honest version.

Here's where to eat, here's when to go, here's what's worth your time. Here's what to skip. Here's how to avoid the mistakes I made.

## what success looks like

I'll know this is working when someone visits Whitstable, uses whitstable.shop to plan their day, and has a genuinely good time because of it.

Not a good time by accident. A good time because they knew to book ahead, to arrive early, to try this place instead of that place, to walk that direction for sunset.

The measure is usefulness. Did this help? Did you leave Whitstable thinking "I'm glad I knew that"?

If yes, the site is doing its job.

## the ongoing thing

This isn't a static project. Whitstable changes. Restaurants open and close. Quality rises and falls. Prices shift. Crowds move.

I'll keep updating, keep adding, keep revising. The guide that was accurate in 2024 won't be accurate forever. Maintenance is part of the commitment.

If something's wrong — if a place has closed, if a recommendation no longer holds, if I've made a mistake — I want to know. This is a living document, not a finished product.

## the invitation

That's why I built this. Frustration leading to creation. The absence of the guide I wanted leading to the attempt to make it.

I don't claim to be the definitive authority on Whitstable. I claim to care about getting it right, to have opinions I'm willing to defend, and to genuinely want visitors to have a good time.

Use the site. Come to Whitstable. Tell me if it helped.
