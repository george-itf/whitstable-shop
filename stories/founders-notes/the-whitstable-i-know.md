# the whitstable I know

Everyone has their own Whitstable. The one they discovered, the one they remember, the one they keep coming back to. Here's mine.

## first memories

I don't remember the first time I came to Whitstable. I know I was young. I know there were oysters involved, and I didn't eat them — too strange, too adult. I remember the shingle beach and the small stones getting into my shoes. I remember thinking it was cold.

Later visits blur together. Day trips. Weekend visits. The usual seaside town experience that many Londoners have with Whitstable — close enough to be accessible, different enough to feel like an escape.

At some point it stopped being "a town I sometimes visit" and became "a place I actually know." I'm not sure when the transition happened. It was gradual. More visits, longer visits, paying attention to more than the obvious.

## the whitstable I found

The Whitstable I know isn't the postcard version. It's not the weekend at the harbour, oysters and wine, Instagram sunset version. That version exists — I've done it, it's nice — but it's not what I mean when I think about the place.

My Whitstable is quieter.

It's walking the harbour arm on a grey Tuesday morning when there's no one else there and the wind is up. It's finding a table at Wheeler's without a queue because it's October and the tourists have gone. It's knowing which backstreet to cut through, which pub the locals actually drink in, which view gets the best light at which time of year.

It's also frustrating sometimes. The crowds in summer. The parking. The way prices have crept up. The sense that something genuine is being commercialised, even if the commercial success is what keeps the town alive.

## how it's changed

People who've known Whitstable longer than me talk about changes I didn't see. The fishing industry when it was more than remnants. The town before the London weekenders arrived. The harbour when it was working and not quaint.

What I've seen is the continued acceleration. More visitors each year. More restaurants opening, some of them good, some of them generic. More coverage in magazines and websites, each piece drawing more attention. Prices rising. Character being both celebrated and diluted.

Is this bad? It's complicated. The money has improved things. Buildings are restored. Businesses survive. There's investment. But there's also the sense of a place being loved to death, of authenticity being packaged for consumption.

I try not to be precious about this. Every generation thinks their Whitstable was the real one, the one before it got ruined. The people who came before me thought the same thing about the changes I didn't witness. It's always changing. It always was.

## what I hope doesn't change

The things that make Whitstable work aren't the things that make it Instagram-famous.

The actual working harbour — the boats that go out, the fish that comes in, the industry that's still there even if diminished. That should stay.

The residential character — Island Wall, the backstreets, the places where locals actually live. The town needs to be a town, not a theme park.

The willingness to be unfashionable — the old-school pubs, the charity shops, the bakeries that just make bread. Not everything needs to be curated for visitors.

The independence — the local shops, the family-run restaurants, the places that exist because someone cared enough to make them exist. The chains should stay away.

And the coast itself. The Slopes, the beach, the sea, the light. That can't change, and that's what everything else is built around.

## my whitstable

The one I keep coming back to is simple.

An October morning. Coffee at Frank when it opens. Walk the harbour arm with no one around. Browse the bookshop, maybe buy something. Lunch at Samphire, a glass of wine, no rush. Walk the Slopes, watch the afternoon light. Drinks at the Neptune, fire if it's cold enough.

Nothing remarkable. Nothing that would make a travel article. Just a good day in a good place.

That's the Whitstable I know. That's what I'm trying to share.
