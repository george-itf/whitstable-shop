# asking shop owners

When I started whitstable.shop, I knew I couldn't just write about places without talking to them. So I hand-delivered envelopes to businesses around town, introducing myself and the project.

This is what happened.

## the approach

I wrote a letter. Kept it short. Explained what I was trying to build — a guide to Whitstable written with genuine local knowledge. Asked if they'd be interested in being featured, what they'd want visitors to know, whether they had any concerns.

I printed the letters, put them in envelopes, and walked around town delivering them. Not emails — physical letters, by hand, in person when possible.

This felt important. I wanted to demonstrate that I wasn't just another online content farm scraping information from Google. I was a real person, making a real effort, asking for real input.

## what shop owners said

The reactions varied.

Some were enthusiastic immediately. They'd been frustrated too — at the TripAdvisor reviews that didn't capture what they did, at the travel articles that got details wrong, at the sense that their story wasn't being told properly.

Some were skeptical. Another website? Another list? They'd been featured before and it hadn't made much difference. What made this different?

Some were busy. Not hostile, just running a business, dealing with customers, not really having time to think about another project.

A few didn't respond at all. That's fair. Not everyone needs to participate in everything.

## what surprised me

The depth of frustration with existing coverage.

One owner described a magazine feature that had got their opening hours wrong, their backstory wrong, and described a dish they didn't serve. They'd given an interview, and somehow the article that came out bore little relation to what they'd said.

Another described dealing with online reviews that were clearly from people who'd never been there — either fake positives from competitors or fake negatives from... who knows.

Several mentioned the disconnect between their experience of running a business in Whitstable and how that business was perceived online. The reviews don't capture the relationships, the regulars, the things that make a place what it actually is.

## what I learned

Accuracy matters more than praise.

Shop owners didn't ask me to say nice things about them. They asked me to get the details right. Opening hours, what they actually serve, who they actually are. The basic facts that so often get mangled.

Context matters. A restaurant in Whitstable isn't just competing with other Whitstable restaurants — it's competing with everywhere anyone has eaten anywhere. Helping visitors understand what kind of experience to expect, what to compare it to, what it's trying to be — that's more valuable than generic praise.

The relationships matter. When I took time to actually visit, to actually talk, to actually understand — that came through. Writing about a place you've genuinely engaged with is different from writing about a place you've researched online.

## the ongoing relationship

This isn't a one-time thing. I check in with places. I update information when things change. I try to maintain the relationships I started with those letters.

Some places have become part of my own Whitstable routine — not because of the project, but because getting to know them made me appreciate them more. That's a side benefit I didn't expect.

If something in a listing is wrong, if something has changed, if there's something shop owners want visitors to know that I've missed — I want to hear about it. The guide gets better when the people featured help make it better.

## what I still believe

The approach of actually asking, actually engaging, actually caring about getting it right — that's what makes this different from the average travel content.

It takes more time. It requires effort. It means hand-delivering letters when emails would be faster.

But the result is better. The information is more accurate. The relationships are real. The coverage is honest.

That's worth doing.
