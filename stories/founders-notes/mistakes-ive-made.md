# mistakes I've made

Building whitstable.shop hasn't been smooth. Here's what I got wrong, what I'm still figuring out, and what I'd do differently.

## trying to cover everything too quickly

Early on, I wanted to be comprehensive. Every restaurant, every shop, every activity. The result was rushed content that didn't reflect the depth I was aiming for.

Some of those early pieces were thin. Surface-level descriptions that could have been written by anyone. They didn't have the specific details, the personal experience, the honest opinions that make a guide worth reading.

**What I learned:** Depth beats breadth. A smaller number of pieces done properly is better than wide coverage done shallowly. I've been going back and rewriting the early stuff.

## not checking facts carefully enough

I got opening hours wrong. I described dishes that had been taken off menus. I attributed things to the wrong buildings. Basic factual errors that undermined trust.

Some of this was out-of-date information. Some was carelessness. All of it was embarrassing.

**What I learned:** Verify everything. And build in a system for updates, because facts change. The restaurant that was open Tuesday-Sunday is now Wednesday-Sunday. The special that was available is now seasonal. Static content goes stale.

## being too positive initially

I wanted to be supportive of local businesses. That's still true. But early content tended toward praise without caveats. "Everything is great" isn't useful — and it's not honest.

Readers need to know the downsides. The queue is long. The prices are high. The service can be slow. Without this information, they can't make informed decisions.

**What I learned:** Honest means mentioning problems. This builds trust more than uninterrupted praise. The places I recommend still get recommended — but readers know what they're getting into.

## underestimating how much maintenance content needs

I thought I could write the pieces and they'd stay accurate. I was wrong.

Places close. Ownership changes. Menus evolve. Prices shift. The guide from six months ago isn't quite the guide you'd write today.

Keeping information current requires ongoing work. Not just occasional updates — regular checks, systematic reviews, a process for catching what's changed.

**What I learned:** Build for maintenance, not just creation. Every piece needs a review schedule. Every fact needs a "last verified" date. This is as important as writing the original content.

---

## not asking for feedback sooner

I developed content in isolation, then published it. I didn't systematically ask readers what they actually found useful, what was missing, what didn't work.

The result was content shaped by my assumptions about what people wanted, rather than actual evidence.

**What I learned:** Ask earlier, ask more. What do visitors actually want to know? What questions does the current content not answer? What would make this genuinely useful?

---

## what I'm still figuring out

**Tone balance.** How critical can honest content be without being unfair? Where's the line between useful warnings and unnecessary negativity?

**Coverage scope.** Should the site cover the whole area (Seasalter, Herne Bay, Canterbury as backup) or stay focused on Whitstable proper?

**Business model.** How does this become sustainable? Advertising, sponsorship, paid features — each has trade-offs with authenticity.

**Voice consistency.** As content expands, maintaining consistent voice and quality is harder. How do you scale personality?

**Keeping up.** The town keeps changing. New places open, standards shift, situations evolve. How do you stay current without making it a full-time job?

## asking for help

I don't have all the answers. That's fine — this is a work in progress.

If you notice something wrong, tell me. If something is missing, tell me. If you have information I should know, tell me.

The best version of this site comes from combining my perspective with input from readers, visitors, locals, and the businesses themselves. No one person knows everything.

## the principle

Mistakes are inevitable. What matters is noticing them, acknowledging them, and fixing them.

This piece is part of that. Publicly saying "here's what I got wrong" is uncomfortable but necessary. It keeps me honest. It signals that I'm trying to do this properly.

The goal isn't perfection. The goal is genuinely useful, honestly written, continuously improved.

I'll keep making mistakes. I'll keep fixing them.
