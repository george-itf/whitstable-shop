# tankerton

Tankerton is the residential end of Whitstable, east along the coast from the harbour. It's quieter, more village-like, and home to the famous Slopes — that long grassy hill that everyone photographs.

Where the harbour area is tourist-central, Tankerton feels like where people actually live.

## the slopes

The Slopes are a long stretch of grass running along the clifftop above Tankerton beach. They're the most photographed view in Whitstable — that sweep of green dropping down to the shingle and the sea.

In summer, the Slopes are covered with picnickers, dog walkers, families with kids rolling down the hill, couples with wine watching the sunset. In winter, it's dog walkers battling the wind and the occasional runner.

The view from the top is excellent: the beach below, the sea stretching out, the distant wind farm on the horizon. Walk from one end to the other and you've had one of the essential Whitstable experiences.

At low tide, you can see The Street — a shingle spit that runs out into the water toward the wind farm. It appears and disappears with the tides, which is part of its appeal.

## the parade of cafés

Along the top of the Slopes runs Marine Parade — a row of cafés, restaurants, and shops that feels entirely different from Harbour Street. Quieter. More local. The sort of places where the same people go every Saturday.

**JoJo's** is the star — the meze restaurant with the famous queues. But there are other spots along here worth knowing: decent cafés for coffee and cake, the Tankerton Arms up the hill with its beer garden views.

The vibe is residential strip mall rather than tourist destination. People pop out for coffee in their slippers. Dogs wait outside shops. It's everyday life rather than holiday performance.

## the beach huts

Tankerton beach is famous for its beach huts — those colourful little wooden cabins lined up along the shore. You can't usually rent them as a visitor (they're privately owned and fiercely guarded), but they make the landscape.

The beach itself is shingle, like all Whitstable beaches. On warm days, people stake out spots among the huts and swim in the cold water. On cold days, it's dog walkers and the hardy few.

The water is genuinely cold. This is the North Sea, not the Mediterranean. People swim, but they don't linger.

## the street

At low tide, a shingle spit called The Street appears, running out from Tankerton beach toward the sea. You can walk out on it for hundreds of meters when the tide is fully out.

This is one of Whitstable's strangest and most memorable features. The timing has to be right — check tide times before going. At high tide, there's nothing to see. At low tide, you can walk out into the sea on dry(ish) land.

It's popular. On summer low-tide evenings, The Street is lined with people walking, photographing, enjoying the strangeness of it. In winter, you might have it almost to yourself.

## less crowded than the harbour

The fundamental Tankerton proposition is space. Where Harbour Street is packed on summer weekends, Tankerton has room. The Slopes can absorb thousands of people without feeling rammed. The beaches stretch in both directions.

If you're coming to Whitstable with a family and you want beach time without fighting for a spot, Tankerton is usually the better choice. It's also better for dogs — more space, fewer crowds, easier to let them run.

The trade-off: fewer restaurants, fewer shops, less "happening." Tankerton is where you go to relax, not where you go for action.

## marine crescent and the posh end

At the eastern end of Tankerton, the houses get bigger and the addresses get fancier. Marine Crescent is the prestigious stretch — Victorian and Edwardian houses with sea views that cost serious money.

This is Whitstable's most desirable residential area. The kind of place people dream of retiring to or weekending in. The houses that go for over a million pounds.

For visitors, it's a nice walk — the architecture is good, the views are excellent, and the contrast with the harbour's tourism is striking. This is where the people who chose Whitstable actually live.

---

## the walk

The classic Tankerton activity is the walk. From the Slopes to Herne Bay if you're ambitious, or just back and forth along the promenade if you're not.

The promenade runs above the beach, separate from the Slopes, and continues east toward Herne Bay. It's flat, paved, and good for cycling or pushing a buggy as well as walking.

At low tide, you can walk on the beach itself. The shingle is harder than sand but walkable. At high tide, stick to the promenade.

## when to come

**Best times:**
- Late afternoon for sunset from the Slopes
- Early morning for quiet beaches
- Low tide if you want to see The Street
- Any time you want escape from harbour crowds

**Avoid:**
- There's nothing to really avoid. Tankerton handles crowds well.
- Extremely low tides do draw crowds to The Street

## the honest summary

Tankerton is the chill side of Whitstable. It's where you go when you want the sea and the space without the tourism. It has fewer restaurants and shops, but what it has is good. The Slopes are genuinely beautiful. The pace is genuinely slower.

For a Whitstable visit, I'd suggest at least a walk through Tankerton. It rounds out the picture — shows you what the town is like beyond the tourist infrastructure. And on a summer evening, watching the sunset from the Slopes with half the town doing the same thing, it feels like the heart of the place.
